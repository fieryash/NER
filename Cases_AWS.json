The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyDAS  J.\\t On the 28th November, 1947, the  appellant  HooseinKasam  Dada  (India) Ltd., (hereinafter referred to  as\\t theassessee) submited to the Sales Tax Officer, Akola, a  SalesTax return in Form IV for the first quarter.  Notice in FormXI calling upon the assessee to produce evidence in  supportof  the\\t said  return having been issued by  the  Sales\\t TaxOfficer, the assessee produced his account books.  Not beingsatisfied  by the inspection of the account books as to\\t thecorrectness  of\\t the return and being of  opinion  that\\t thetaxable\\t turnover  exceeded rupees two lacs  the  Sales\\t TaxOfficer submitted the case to the Assistant Commissioner  ofSales Tax, Amravati, for assessment,989On the 25th January, 1949, the Assistant Commissioner issueda  fresh  notice in Form XI under section 11 and  fixed\\t thecase for disposal on the 5th February, 1949.  After  variousadjournments and proceedings to which it is not necessary torefer, the hearing commenced on the 9th June, 1949, when  anagent of the assessee appeared with books of account of\\t theAkola Branch.  Eventually after various further\\t proceedingsthe Assistant Commissioner on the 8th April, 1950,  assessedthe assessee, to the best of his judgment, in the sum of Rs.58,657140  and a copy of the order in Form XIV was  sent  tothe  assessee.\\tBeing aggrieved by the order  of  assessmentthe  assessee on the 10th May, 1950, preferred an appeal  tothe  Sales Tax Commissioner, Madhya Pradesh,  under  section22(l) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947(hereinafter referred to as the Act).  The appeal not havingbeen  accompanied by any proof of the payment of the tax  inrespect\\t of  which  the\\t appeal\\t had  been  preferred,\\t theauthorities, after giving the assessee several adjournments,declined to admit the appeal.  The assessee moved the  Boardof  Revenue,  Madhya  Pradesh,\\tby  a  revision\\t applicationagainst\\t the order of the Sales Tax Commissioner  contendingthat  his appeal was not governed by the proviso to  section22(l)  of the Act as amended on the 25th November, 1949,  bythe Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax (Second Amendment)Act  (Act LVII of 1949) but was governed by the\\t proviso  tosection\\t 22(l)\\tof the Act as it stood when  the  assessmentproceedings  were started, i.e., before the said  amendment.The  Board  of Revenue took the view that as  the  order  ofassessment  was made after the amendment of the section\\t andthe appeal was filed thereafter such appeal must be governedby  the\\t provisions  of law as it existed at  the  time\\t theappeal\\twas  actually filed and that the law as\\t it  existedbefore the filing of the appeal could not apply to the case.The  assessee  thereupon  moved the  High  Court  of  MadhyaPradesh\\t under articles 226 and 227 of the  Constitution  ofIndia praying, amongst other things, for a writ of  mandamusor an appropriate128990order directing the Sales Tax Commissioner to admit and hearthe appeal without demanding payment of the amount of  salestax  assessed  by the Assistant Commissioner of\\t Sales\\tTax.The High Court dismissed the application on the 2nd  August,1951.\\tThe assessee\\tapplied to the High Court for  leaveto  appeal  to this  Court which was also dismissed  by\\t theHigh Court on the 14th March, 1952.  'The assessee thereuponapplied\\t to  this Court for special leave to appeal  on\\t the12th May, 1952.\\t This Court granted special leave to appeal,but  such  leave  was, by the  order  granting\\tsuch  leave,limited\\t to the question of the effect of the  amendment  tosection\\t 22  of the Act on the petitioner's  appeal  to\\t theSales Tax Commissioner, Madhya Pradesh.\\t This Court took theview  that  the other questions sought to be raised  by\\t theassessee  would\\t have  to  be  decided\\tby  the\\t Sales\\t TaxCommissioner  in case the appeal succeeded.  The appeal\\t hasnow come up for final disposal before us and in this  appealwe  are\\t concerned  only with the limited  question  of\\t theeffect of the amendment to section 22 of the Act.Section\\t 22(l)\\tof the Act was originally expressed  in\\t thefollowing terms :-\", '\"22': '(1)  Any dealer aggrieved by an order under  this\\t Actmay,  in  the prescribed manner, appeal\\t to  the  prescribedauthority against the order:\\nProvided that no appeal against an order of assessment, withor  without penalty shall be admitted by the said  authorityunless such appeal is accompanied by a satisfactory proof ofthe payment of the tax, with991penalty,  if  any, in respect of which the appeal  has\\tbeenpreferred.\"\\nIt is clear from the language used in the proviso to section22 (1) as it stood prior to the amendment that an  aggrievedassessee  had  only to pay such amount of tax  as  he  mightadmit  to  be  due from him, whereas under  the\\t proviso  tosection 22(l) as amended the appeal has to be accompanied bysatisfactory proof of payment of the tax in respect of whichthe  appeal  had  been preferred.   The\\t contention  of\\t thepresent assessee is that as the amendment has not been\\tmaderetrospective its right of appeal under the original section22(l) remains unaffected and that accordingly as it does notadmit  anything to be due it was not liable to\\tdeposit\\t anysum along with its appeal and the Commissioner was bound  toadmit its appeal and had no jurisdiction or power to  rejectit  on\\tthe ground that it had not been accompanied  by\\t anyproof  of payment of the tax assessed against the  appellantas  required  under  the amended proviso and  the  Board  ofRevenue\\t and the High Court were in error in  not  directingthe Commissioner to admit the appeal.\\nThat  the amendment has placed a substantial restriction  onthe  assessee\\'s right of appeal cannot be disputed, for\\t theamended section requires the payment of the entire  assessedamount\\tas  a condition precedent to the  admission  of\\t itsappeal.\\t  The question is whether the imposition of  such  arestriction  by\\t amendment  of the section  can\\t affect\\t theassessee\\'s  right of appeal from a decision  in\\t proceedingswhich  commenced prior to such amendment and which right  ofappeal was free from such restriction under the section asitstood at the time of the commencement\\tof the\\tproceedings.The question was answered     in   the\\t negative   by\\t theJudicial Committee in Colonial.\\t Sugar Refining Co., Ltd. v.Irving(1).   In\\t that case the Collector of  Customs  actingunder  an Act called the Excise Tariff Act,  1902,  requiredthe appellants to pay pound 20,100 excise duty on 6,700 tonsof  sugar.   The  appellants disputed the  claim.   So\\ttheydeposited(1)  L.R. [1905] A.C. 369.\\nthe money with the Collector and then brought the action  byissuing\\t a writ on the 25th October, 1902.  A  special\\tcasehaving\\tbeen  stated for the opinion of the  Supreme  Court,that Court on the 4th September, 1903, gave judgment for theCollector.   In\\t the meantime the Judiciary Act,  1903,\\t waspassed\\tand received Royal assent on the 25th August,  1903,that  is  to  say  about 10 days  before  the  judgment\\t wasdelivered.  By section 39(2) of that Act the right of appealfrom  the Supreme Court to the Privy Council given  by\\tthe;Order in Council of 1860 was taken away and the only  appealtherefrom  was\\tdirected  to  lie  to  the  High  Court\\t  ofAustralia.   The  appellants having with the  leave  of\\t theSupreme\\t Court\\tfiled  an appeal to the\\t Privy\\tCouncil\\t therespondents  filed a petition taking the  preliminary  pointthat no appeal lay to the Privy Council and praying that theappeal\\tbe  dismissed. in dismissing that  application\\tLordMacnaghten  who delivered the judgment of the Privy  Councilsaid:-\\n\"As  regards the general principles applicable to  the\\tcasethere  was  no\\tcontroversy.  On the one hand,\\tit  was\\t notdisputed  that\\tif  the matter in question be  a  matter  ofprocedure only, the petition is well founded.  On the  otherhand,  if  it  be more than a matter  of  procedure,  if  ittouches a right in existence at the passing of the Act,-  itwas  conceded  that,  in  accordance with  a  long  line  ofauthorities  extending\\tfrom the time of Lord  Coke  to\\t thepresent\\t day, the appellants would be entitled\\tto  succeed.The  Judicary Act is not retrospective by express  enactmentor by necessary intendment.  And therefore the only questionis, was the appeal to His Majesty in Council a right  vestedin the appellants at the date of the passing of the Act,  orwas  it\\t a  mere matter of procedure ?\\tIt  seems  to  theirLordships  that\\t the question does not admit of\\t doubt.\\t  Todeprive\\t a  suitor  in a pending action of an  appeal  to  asuperior  tribunal  which belonged to him as of right  is  avery different thing from regulating procedure.\\t In  princi-ple, their Lordships see no difference between abolishing anappeal\\taltogether  and\\t transferring the appeal  to  a\\t newtribunal.  In either case there is an interference993with  existing\\trights contrary to  the\\t well-known  generalprinciple   that  statutes  are\\t not  to  be  held  to\\t actretrospectively\\t unless a clear intention to that effect  ismanifested.\"\\nThe  principle of the above decision was applied by  JenkinsC.J. in Nana bin Aba v. Sheku bin Andu (1) and by the  PrivyCouncil itself in Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd.  v.Income-tax  Commissioner,  Delhi(\\').  A Full  Bench  of\\t theLahore\\tHigh  Court adopted it in Kirpa\\t Singh\\tv.  RasaldarAjaipal\\t Singh (3).  It was there regarded as  settled\\tthatthe  right of appeal was not a mere matter of procedure\\t butwas  a\\tvested right which inhered in a party from  the\\t commencement  of the action in the Court of first instance\\t andsuch  right  could not be taken away except  by\\t an  expressprovision or by necessary implication.\\nIn  Sardar Ali v. Dalimuddin (4), the suit out of which\\t theappeal arose was filed in the Munsiff \\'s Court at Alipore onthe  7th October, 1920.\\t The suit having been  dismissed  onthe 17th July, 1924, the plaintiffs appealed to the Court ofthe  District  Judge  but the  appeal  was  dismissed.\\t Theplaintiffs then preferred a second appeal to the High  Courton the 4th October, 1926.  That second appeal was heard by aSingle\\tJudge and was dismissed on the 4th April, 1928.\\t  Inthe meantime Clause 15 of the Letters Patent was amended  onthe  14th  January  1928 so as to provide  that\\t no  furtherappeal\\tshould\\tlie  from the decision\\tof  a  Single  Judgesitting in second appeal unless the Judge certified that thecase  was  a fit one for appeal.  In this case\\tthe  learnedJudge  who  dismissed the second appeal on  the\\t 4th  April,1928,  declined\\t to give any certificate  of  fitness.\\t Theplaintiffs  on the 30th April, 1928, filed an appeal on\\t thestrength  of  clause 15 of the Letters Patent  as  it  stoodbefore the amendment.  The contention of the appellants\\t wasthat the amended clause could not be applied to that appeal,for  to\\t do so would be to apply it retrospectively  and  toimpair and indeed to defeat a substantive right which was inexistence(1)  (1908)  I.L.R. 32 Bom. 337.    (3) A. I. R\\t  1928\\tLah.', '6272': '(1927) L.R. 54 I.A. 421 ; I.L.R. 9 Lah. 284. (4)  (1929)I.L.R. 56 Cal. 5I2.\\nprior to the date of the amendment.  The apppllants  claimedthat on the 7th October, 1920, when the suit was filed\\ttheyhad  vested in them by the existing law a substantive  rightto  a  Letters Patent appeal from the decision of  a  SingleJudge and that an intention to interfere with it, to clog itwith a new condition or to impair or imperil it could not bepresumed  unless it was clearly manifested by express  wordsor   necessary\\t intendment.   In  giving  effect   to\\t thecontentions  of\\t the appellants Rankin C.J. observed  at  p.518:-\\nNow, the reasoning of the Judicial Committee in The ColonialSugar  Refining Company\\'s case is a conclusive authority  toshow that rights of appeal are not matters of procedure, andthat  the  right  to enter the superior\\t court\\tis  for\\t thepresent\\t purpose  deemed to arise to a litigant\\t before\\t anydecision  has  been  given by the inferior  court.   If\\t thelatter\\tproposition be accepted, I can see  no\\tintermediatepoint  at  which  to resist the conclusion  that  the  rightarises at the date of the suit.\"\\nIt  was\\t held  that  the  new  clause  could  not  be  givenretrospective  effect  and  accordingly\\t the  date  of\\tpre-sentation of the second appeal to the High Court was not thedate  which  determined\\t the applicability  of\\tthe  amendedclause\\tof  the\\t Letters Patent and that  the  date  of\\t theinstitution of the suit was the determining factor.As against the last mentioned decision of the Calcutta\\tHighCourt  Sri  Ganapathy Aiyar, appearing for  the\\t respondent,refers\\tus  to the decision of a Bench of  the\\tBombay\\tHighCourt  in  the\\tcase of Badruddin  Abdul  Rahim\\t v.  SitaramVinayak\\t Apte (1), where it was held that the  amendment  ofclause\\t15 of the Letters Patent  operated  retrospectively.That  case  followed an earlier decision of  the  same\\tHighCourt  in  Fram\\t Bomanji  v.  Hormasji\\tBarjorji  (2).\\t Thedecision in the old case proceeded upon two grounds, namely,(1) that the question was one of procedure and (2) that sec-(1)  (1928) I.L R. 52 Bom. 753; A.I.R. (1928) Bom. 371.(2)  (1866) Bom.  H.C. (O.C.J.) 49.\\ntion 2 of the New Letters Patent of 1865 gave  retrospectiveoperation  to the Letters Patent by making it applicable  toall  pending  suits.   In  so far as  the  first  ground  isconcerned  it  clearly runs counter to the decision  of\\t thePrivy Council in Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd. v.  Irving(supra) and must be taken as overruled as Fawcett J. himselfacknowledged  at page 756.  As regards the second ground  itis  inapplicable  to  the  case before\\tus  and\\t it  is\\t notnecessary  to express any opinion as to the.  soundness\\t andvalidity  of that ground.  It may be mentioned here that  inShaikh\\tHasan Abdul Karim v. King Emperor (1) another  Benchof the same High Court expressly dissented from the decisionin  Badruddin Abdul Rahim v. Sitaram Vinayak  Apte  (supra).The principle laid down in the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.\\'scase (supra) was followed by a Special Bench of Madras in Inre Vasudeva Samiar (2).\\t A Full Bench of the Allahabad\\tHighCourt in Ram Singha v. Shankar Dayal (3) fell into line\\t andheld  that the earlier decision on this point of that  Courtin Zamin Ali Khan v. Genda (4) stood overruled by the  PrivyCouncil decision in the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.\\'s  case.A  Full Bench of Nagpur High Court in Radhakisan v.  Shridar(5  ) has also taken the same view.  The Punjab\\t High  Courthas  also  adopted  the\\t same line in  Gordhan\\tDas  v.\\t TheGovernor General in Council (1).\\nThe  case of Nagendra Nath Bose v. Mon Mohan Singha Roy\\t (7)is  indeed  very  much\\tto the\\tpoint.\\t In  that  case\\t theplaintiffs instituted a suit for rent valued at Rs.  1,30615and  obtained  a decree.  In execution of  that\\t decree\\t thedefaulting  tenure was sold on the 20th November, 1928,\\t forRs.  1,600.  On the 19th December, 1928, an application\\t wasmade,  under  Order  XXI,  rule 90  of\\tthe  Code  of  CivilProcedure,  by\\tthe present petitioner, who was one  of\\t thejudgment-debtors,(1)  I.L.R (1945) Bom. 17.', '2': '(1952) S.C.J. 564.\\nrepelled this argument with the remark at\\tpage520:-\\n\"  Unless  the contrary can be shown,  the  provision  whichtakes  away  jurisdiction is itself subject to\\tthe  impliedsaving of the litigants\\' right.\"\\nIn  our view the above observation is apposite and  appliesto  the case before us.\\t The true implication of  the  aboveobservation as of the decisions in the other cases  referredto  above  is that the pre-existing right of appeal  is\\t notdestroyed  by  the amendment if the amendment  is  not\\tmaderetrospective by express words or necessary intendment.\\t Thefact  that  the pre-existing right of  appeal  continues  toexist must, in its turn, necessarily imply that the old\\t lawwhich  created\\tthat  right of appeal  must  also  exist  tosupport\\t the  continuation of that right.  As  the  old\\t lawcontinues  to exist for the purpose of supporting  the\\tpre-existing  right\\t of  appeal that old  law  must\\t govern\\t theexercise  and enforcement of that right of appeal and  therecan then be no question of the amended provision  preventingthe exercise of that right.  The argument that the authorityhas no option or jurisdiction to admit the appeal unless  itbe  accompanied\\t by  the  deposit of  the  assessed  tax  asrequired by the amended proviso to section 22(1)  of the Actoverlooks  the\\tfact  of existence of the old  law  for\\t thepurpose of supporting the     pre-existing right  and  reallyamounts to begging the question.  The new proviso is  whollyinapplicable in such a situation and the jurisdiction of theauthority  has\\tto be exercised under the old law  which  socontinues  to exist.  The argument of Sri Ganapathy lyer  onthis point, therefore, cannot be accepted.The  learned  Advocate urges that the requirment as  to\\t thedeposit of the amount of the assessed costs does not  affectthe  right of appeal itself which still remains intact,\\t butonly introduces a new matter of procedure.  He contends thatthis case is quite different from the case of Sardar Ali  v.Dalmuddin  (supra), for in this case it is entirely  in\\t thepower  of the appellant to deposit the tax if he chooses  todo so whereas it was not999within\\tthe power of the appellant in that case to secure  acertificate  from the learned Single Judge who\\tdisposed  ofthe second appeal.  In the first place the onerous conditionmay  in\\t a given case prevent the exercise of the  right  ofappeal,\\t for the assessee may not be in a position  to\\tfindthe  necessary money in time.  Further this argument  cannotprevail\\t in view of the decision of the Calcutta High  Courtin  Nagendra  Nath  Bose v. Mon Mohan  Singha  (supra).\\t  Nocogent argument has been adduced before us to show that thatdecision is not correct.  There can be no doubt that the newrequirement \"touches\" the substantive right of appeal vestedin  the\\t appellant.  Nor can it be overlooked  that  such  arequirement  is calculated to interfere with or\\t fetter,  ifnot to impair or imperil, the substantive right.  The  rightthat  the amended section gives is certainly less  than\\t theright  which  was available before.  A\\tprovision  which  iscalculated to deprive the appellant of the unfettered  rightof  appeal  cannot  be\\tregarded as  a\\tmere  alteration  inprocedure.  Indeed the new requirement cannot be said merelyto  regulate  the exercise of the  appellant\\'s\\tpre-existingright but in truth whittles down the right itself and cannotbe regarded as a mere rule of procedure.\\nFinally, Sri Ganapathy lyer faintly urges that until  actualassessment there can be no \\'lis\\' and, therefore, no right ofappeal can accrue before that event.  There are two  answersto this plea.  Whenever there is a proposition by one  partyand  an\\t opposition to that proposition by another  a  \\'lis\\'arises.\\t  It may be conceded, though not deciding  it,\\tthatwhen  the  assessee  files  his\\t return\\t a  \\'lis\\'  may\\t notimmediately  arise, for under section 11 (1)  the  authoritymay  accept the return as correct and complete.\\t But if\\t theauthority  is  not satisfied as to the\\tcorrectness  of\\t thereturn\\tand calls for evidence, surely a controversy  arisesinvolving a proposition by the assessee and an opposition bythe  State.  The circumstance that the authority who  raisesthe dispute is himself the judge can make no difference, forthe  authority\\traises the dispute in the  interest  of\\t theState and in so acting only represents the State.  It1000will appear from the dates given above that in this case the\\'lis\\' in the sense explained above arose before the date  ofamendment of the section.  Further, even if the \\'lis\\' is  tobe  taken as arising only on the date of  assessment,  therewas  a\\tpossibility  of\\t such a \\'lis\\'  arising\\tas  soon  asproceedings  started with the filing of the  return  or,  atany rate, when the authority called for evidence and startedthe  hearing and the right of appeal must be taken  to\\thavebeen in existence even at those dates.\\tFor the purposes  ofthe accrual of the right of appeal the critical and relevantdate  is the date of initiation of the proceedings  and\\t notthe decision itself.\\nFor  all the reasons given above we are of the opinion\\tthatthe appellant\\'s appeal should not have been rejected on\\t theground that it was not accompanied by satisfactory proof  ofthe  payment of the assessed tax.  As the appellant did\\t notadmit  that  any  amount was due by it,\\t it  was  under\\t thesection\\t as it stood previously entitled to file its  appealwithout\\t depositing any sum of money.  We, therefore,  allowthis  appeal and direct that the appeal be admitted  by\\t theCommissioner  and  be decided in accordance with  law.\\t Theappellant  is  entitled to the costs of this appeal  and  weorder accordingly.\\nAppeal allowed.\\nAgent for appellant: Rajinder Narain.\\nAgent for respondent: G.

That. application having\\tbeendismissed  for\\tdefault\\t of his\\t appearance  the  petitionerpreferred  an  appeal to the District Judge  of\\t Hoogly\\t whorefused\\t to admit the appeal on the ground that\\t the  amountrecoverable  in\\t execution  of\\tthe  decree  had  not\\tbeendeposited as required by the proviso to section 174,  clause', 'c,': 'of the Bengal Tenancy Act as amended by an amending Actin  1928.   The contention of the petitioner  was  that\\t theamended\\t provision  which  came\\t into  force  on  the\\t21stFebruary, 1929, could not affect the right of appeal from  adecision on an application made on the 19th December,  1928,for setting aside the sale.  Mitter J. said at page 1011:-\"  We think the contention of the petitioner is\\t wellfoundedand  must prevail.  That a right of appeal is a\\t substantiveright  cannot now be seriously disputed.  It is not  a\\tmerematter\\tof procedure.  Prior to the amendment of 1928  therewas an appeal against an order refusing to set aside a\\tsale(for  that is the effect also where the application  to\\t setaside\\tthe  sale  is  dismissed  for  default)\\t under\\t theprovisions  of\\tOrder  43, rule (1), of the  Code  of  CivilProcedure.  That right was unhampered by any restriction  ofthe kind now imposed by section 174(5), Proviso.  The  Courtwas  bound to admit the appeal whether\\tappellant  depositedthe  amount recoverable in execution of the decree  or\\tnot.By  requiring such deposit as a condition precedent  to\\t theadmission  of the appeal, a new restriction has been put  onthe  right of appeal, the, admission of which is now  hedgedin  with a condition.  There can be no doubt that the  rightof appeal has been affected by the new provision and in\\t theabsence of an express enactment this amendment cannot  applyto  proceedings pending at the date when the  new  amendmentcame into force.  It is true that the appeal was filed afterthe   Act  came\\t into  force,  but  that   circumstance\\t  isimmaterial--for the date to be looked into for this  purposeis  the\\t date of the original  proceeding  which  eventuallyculminated in the appeal.\"\\nThe,   above  decisions\\t quite\\tfirmly\\testablish  and\\t ourdecisions  in Janardan Reddy v. The State (1) and in  GanpatRai  v.\\t Agarwal  Chamber of Commerce Ltd.  (2)\\t uphold\\t theprinciple  that a right of appeal is not merely a matter  ofprocedure.   It is matter of substantive right.\\t This  rightof  appeal from the decision of an .inferior tribunal  to  asuperior tribunal becomes vested in a party when proceedingsare  first initiated in, and before a decision is given\\t by,the inferior court.  In the language of Jenkins C.J. in Nanabin  Aba  v. Shaik bin Andu (supra) to disturb\\tan  existingright of appeal is not a mere alteration in procedure.\\tSucha  vested  right  cannot be taken  away\\t except\\t by  expressenactment   or\\tnecessary  intendment.\\t An  [intention\\t  tointerfere  with or to impair or imperil such a vested  rightcannot\\t be  presumed  unless  such  intention\\tbe   clearlymanifested by express words or necessary implication.Sri Ganapathy Aiyar urges that the language of section 22(1)as  amended clearly makes the section ret. rospective.\\t Thenew  proviso, it is pointed out, peremptorily  requires\\t theauthority  not to admit the appeal unless it be\\t accompaniedby a satisfactory proof of the payment of the tax in respectof which the appeal is preferred and this duty the authoritymust discharge at the time the appeal is actually  preferredbefore\\thim.  The argument is that after the  amendment\\t theauthority  has\\tno  option  in the  matter  and\\t he  has  nojurisdiction to admit any appeal unless the assessed tax  bedeposited.  It follows, therefore, by necessary implication,according   to\\tthe  learned  Advocate,\\t that  the   amendedprovision applies to an appeal from an assessment order madebefore the date of amendment as well as to an appeal from anorder  made after that date.  A similar argument  was  urgedbefore\\t the  Calcutta\\tSpecial\\t Bench\\tin  Sardar  Ali\\t  v.Dalimuddin  (supra),  namely, that after the  amendment\\t thecourt  had  no authority to entertain an  appeal  without  acertificate from the Single Judge.', '1': '[1950] S.C.R. 941.'}", "blockQuotes": []}], "equivalentCitations": ["1953 AIR  221", "1953 SCR  987"], "date": {"day": "23", "month": "2", "year": "1953"}, "titlePetitioners": "Hoosein Kasam Dada (India) Ltd", "titleRespondants": "The State Of Madhya Pradesh And", "id": "SC000708"}

His wife had predeceased him but Jagdishwar Prasad Singh did not marry a second wife. It is alleged that Jagdishwar Prasad Singh had on the 18th December 1930 made his last will and testament. This will purports to have been attested by two witnesses, namely, one Sahdeo Singh, an Advocate practising at Ghazipur, and one Rameshwar Lal, since deceased, who was an Honorary Magistrate of Ghazipur. By this will the testator appointed one of his step-brothers, namely Ishwardeo Narain Singh, as the executor. By the will he directed that the entire fixed rate tenancy in village Billahri should be sold and the sale proceeds utilised towards the expenses relating to the marriage of his daughter and that until the property was sold the income thereof should be accumulated and should be utilised towards the expenses relating to the maintenance and marriage of the daughter. He further directed that after his death a grove should be planted in certain lands situate in village Kundesar and a temple should be constructed in the grove and an idol of Sri Thakurji should be installed therein and all the Zamindari rights together with the grove and the 'katcha' properties and the Zamindari share in certain villages mentioned therein should be dedicated to Thakurji and the income therefrom should be utilised towards the expenses relating to the Rag, Bhog, Puja and construction and repairs of the Thakur Bari, etc. He appointed his stepbrother Ishwardeo Narain Singh as the trustee and manager of the Thakur Bari and the property dedicated to Thakurji.\\nOn the 29th October 1934 Ishwardeo Narain Singh presented a petition to the District Judge, Ghazipur, for the grant of probate to him. At the foot of that petition, Rameshwar Lal, one of the attesting witnesses, declared that he was present and saw the testator affix his signature thereto. The estate was valued at Rs. 3,000. An objection was put in on behalf of Srimati Kamta Devi, the daughter of the testator. At the trial, amongst others, evidence was given by the attesting witness Sahdeo Singh as to the due execution of the will and the testamentary capacity of the testator. The other attesting witness Rameshwar Lal was also called as a witness. After examination-in-chief his cross-examination began but before the cross-examination was complete that witness died and consequently his evidence could not be used as evidence in the case. The trial Court was satisfied that the will had been duty executed and that the testator had a sound disposing mind. He, however, found that the disposition contained in the will in favour of Thakurji was void for uncertainty and relying on a decision in - 'Phundan Lal v. Arya Prithi Nidhi Sabha', 33 All 793 (A), the learned District Judge held that the will was not expressive of any definite intention and was, therefore, not a will as defined in Section 2(h) of the Indian Succession Act. In view of this finding the learned District Judge rejected the application for probate.\\nAn appeal was taken to the High Court. The High Court held that the due execution of the will had not been proved. The High Court also held the view that the will was void for uncertainty and on both of these grounds the High Court affirmed the judgment of the trial Court and dismissed the appeal. The petitioner applied to the High Court for leave to appeal to the Privy Council but such application was dismissed. The petitioner thereafter applied to the Privy Council and obtained special leave to appeal. The appeal has since then been transferred to this Court and has now come up for hearing.\"}", "subPara": "{}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'2': 'The dismissal of the application for probate on the ground that the disposition in favour of Thakurji is void for uncertainty can on no principle be supported and indeed learned counsel appearing for the respondent has not sought to do so. The Court of Probate is only concerned with the question as to whether the document put forward as the last will and testament of a deceased person was duly executed and attested in accordance with law and whether at the time of such execution the testator had sound disposing mind. The question whether a particular bequest is good or bad is not within the purview of the probate Court. It is surprising how this elementary principle of law was overlooked by both the Courts below.

The High Court, however, took the view hat the due execution of the will had not been proved and that the evidence of the only attesting witness Sahdeo Singh could not be accepted in view of the surrounding circumstances. The first circumstance referred to was that the will was an unnatural will. The testator had no male issue out had only one minor daughter. His wife had predeceased him and he had not married a second wife. By his will he made provision for the marriage of his daughter out of certain specified part of his estate. The rest of his properties he gave to Thakurji.

In the first place it is not accurate to say that the entire property was dedicated in favour of charity, because provision was made for the marriage of his only daughter. Further, there may conceivably be diverse reasons which prevented the testator from building a temple during his lifetime.'}", "subPara": "{}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'6': \"Finally, the circumstance that Sahdeo Singh is an Advocate and a friend of Ishwardeo Narain Singh's elder brother who is also a lawyer has been referred to as a ground for rejecting his evidence. We are wholly unable to accept this line of reasoning. Sahdeo is a person who pays land revenue of over Rs. 4,000 per annum. He is a practising Advocate. He acted as Advocate for the testator in one or two appeals. The estate of the testator was a small one, valued at Rs. 3,000 only. It is impossible to hold that a respectable man of the position of Sahdeo Singh should collude with the stepbrothers of the testator in putting up a forged will in respect of such a small estate.\"}", "subPara": "{}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'7': 'Comment has been made that the testator was not on good terms with his father and his stepbrothers.

It is also in evidence that the testator signed an application for execution of a decree obtained by his father acting as the general agent of his father. It is also in evidence that although the testator had separated, he and his father and stepbrothers used to pay land revenue jointly. There is nothing improbable in the family disputes being settled. In these circumstances there is nothing improbable in the testator appointing one of his stepbrothers as the executor of his will. It is in evidence that these stepbrothers have married the minor daughter of the testator in quite a well to do family. Taking all the circumstances into consideration we are clearly of the opinion that the High Court was not justified in taking a different view as to the credibility of the witness Sahdeo Singh who was entirely believed by the District Judge who had seen him in the witness-box before him.'}", "subPara": "{}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'8': 'The result, therefore, is that this appeal must be allowed and we direct probate to issue to the petitioner.

It was held  that\\t themurder\\twas  brutal  and advantage had\\tbeen  taken  of\\t thepersons\\t who were sleeping to kill them.  In the result\\t theappellants  were convicted under section 302,  Indian  PenalCode, and sentenced to death.  The sentence of death  passedon  them  by the sessions judge was confirmed  by  the\\tHighCourt  after  examining the evidence afresh.   In  the\\tHighCourt  a  contention  was raised that the  whole  trial\\t wasvitiated inasmuch as it had not been conducted in accordancewith  procedure\\t prescribed  by law.   This  contention\\t wasnegatived on the ground that the irregularities committed inthe course of the trial were such as were cured by the\\tpro-visions\\t of  section 537, Criminal Procedure Code.   As\\t theobjection  raised  concerned the validity of the  trial\\t thecase was certified as a fit one for appeal to this Court.The  facts which concern the validity of the trial,  shortlystated,\\t are  these: The trial began on\\t 22nd  March,  1952.Three  assessors had been summoned for that date.  Of  thesetwo  were present while the third did not  come.   Thereuponone  person who was present in the court premises and  whosename  was  in  the list of assessors but who  had  not\\tbeensummoned  in the manner prescribed by the Code\\tof  CriminalProcedure  was chosen as an assessor.  The trial then  beganwith   the  three  assessors  so  chosen,   viz.,   Jethmal,Balkrishna and Asharam.\\t On the 6th June, 1952, Jethmal, oneof the assessors absented himself and for some reason, whichis not clear from the record, one Chimniram was asked to sitin  place of Jethmal as an assessor with the result that  onthe  6th  June,\\t 1952, there  were  three  assessors,  viz.,Balkrishna  and\\t Asharam,  who had  been  sitting  from\\t thebeginning  -of the trial, and Chimniram who  was  introducedfor  the  first\\t time  that day.   On  the  23rd  June\\talsoChimniram, Balkrishna and Asharam sat as assessors.  On 27thJune, however, Jethmal reappeared and was allowed to sit andsince  that  date  four\\t assessors  sat\\t throughout,   viz.,Jethmal, Chimniram, Balkrishna and Asharam.  Eventually\\t allthese four assessors gave their opinion on the first977July,  1952,  when  the trial came to an end.\\tIt  was\\t contended\\tthat the trial was bad as it took place in  defianceof  the\\t provisions of sections 284 and 285 of the  Code  ofCriminal Procedure and that such an illegality could not  becured by the provisions of section 537 of the Code.In  order to judge of the validity of this objection  it  isnecessary to set out the provisions of the Code relevant  tothis matter.  Section 284 provides that, \"When the trial  isto  be held with the aid of assessors, not less\\t than  threeand,  if  possible, four shall be chosen  from\\tthe  personssummoned  to  act as such\" . The section  as  it  originallystood  required\\t that \" two or more shall be chosen  as\\t theJudge thinks fit \", so that there had to be a minimum of twoassessors.  In the year 1923, that provision was amended  soas  to\\tmake  a\\t minimum of  three  assessors  an  essentialrequisite for a trial to be held with the aid of  assessors.A  trial  commenced with less than three  assessors  is\\t notauthorised  by\\tthe  provisions of this section\\t as  it\\t nowstands.\\t   Therefore,  unless  a  case\\tcomes\\twithin\\t theprovisions  of the next following section 285, a trial\\theldin  defiance of the provisions of section 284 would  not  belegal.\\t Section 285, however, has no application  to  caseswhere  a trial is commenced with less than three  assessors.[Vide Balak Singh v. Emperor (1); Sipattar Singhv.   King-Emperor (2)].\\t Section 285 provides :-\"(1) If in the course of a trial with the aid of  assessors,at  any\\t time before the finding, any assessor is  from\\t anysufficient  cause, prevented from attending  throughout\\t thetrial,\\tor  absents himself, and it is\\tnot  practicable  toenforce his attendance, the trial shall proceed with the aidof the other assessor or assessors.', '2If': 'all  the assessors are prevented\\t from  attending  orabsent themselves, the proceedings shall be stayed and a newtrial shall be held with the aid of fresh assessors.\"In cases contemplated by this section a trial commenced withthe aid of three assessors can be(1) A.I.R. 1918 Pat. 420.   (2) A.I.R. 1942 All, 140.\\ncontinued  and\\tfinished  with the aid of  less\\t than  threeassessors.   This section, however, does  neither  authorizethe substitution of an assessor for an absent assessor,\\t nordoes  it authorise an addition of an assessor to the  numberof assessors during the course of the trial.  The effect  ofthe  provisions\\t of  sections 284 and 285 is  that  a  trialcannot\\tbe validly commenced with less than three  assessorschosen\\tin  the\\t manner prescribed by  the  Code,  but\\toncevalidly commenced it can be continued in certain cases to  afinish\\tif some, though not all, of the\\t persons  originallyappointed,  attend throughout the trial.  If all of them  donot attend, then a fresh trial has to be held.\\tAn  additionin  the number of the assessors or a change or\\tsubstitutionin  their  personnel during the course of the trial  is\\t notwarranted  by the Code; on the other hand, it is  implicitlyprohibited.   The procedure prescribed by section 285(l)  isnot  of a permissive nature.  It has to be followed  if\\t theconditions prescribed are fulfilled, and like section 285(2)it  is of a mandatory character.  No scope is left in  theseprovisions  for the exercise of the discretion of the  judgefor  supplementing these provisions and for holding a  trialin  a  manner  different from the  one\\tprescribed  and\\t forconducting  it\\twith the aid of\\t some  assessors  originallyappointed,  and also with the aid of some  others  recruitedduring the trial.  Section 309 provides that when a trial isconcluded,  the\\t court\\tmay  sum up  the  evidence  for\\t theprosecution  and defence and shall then require each of\\t theassessors to state his opinion orally and shall record\\tsuchopinions.   Sub-clause (2) of this section enacts  that\\t thejudge shall then give judgment, but in doing so shall not bebound to conform to the opinions of the assessors.  Sections326  and  327  enact  the method  and  manner  of  summoningassessors and jurors.  Section 537 provides as follows:-\"Subject  to  the  provisions  hereinbefore  contained,\\t  nofinding,  sentence or order passed by a Court  of  competentjurisdiction  shall  be reversed or  altered  under  ChapterXXVII or on appeal or revision on account-', 'aof': 'any error, omission or irregularity in the  complaint,summons,  warrant, charge, proclamation, order, judgment  orother  proceedings before or during trial or in any  inquiryor other proceedings under this Code, or...', 'cof': 'the omission to revise any list of jurors or assessorsin accordance with section 324, or', 'dof': 'any misdirection in any charge to a jury, unless\\tsucherror,\\tomission, irregularity or misdirection has  in\\tfactoccasioned a failure of justice.\"\\nThe first objection that was taken in the High Court to\\t thevalidity  of  the trial was that Asharam who  had  not\\tbeensummoned  as an assessor could not be appointed as such\\t andhence  it  should be held that the trial  commenced  with  aminimum\\t of two assessors in defiance of the  provisions  ofsection 284.  What happened was this: On the date fixed\\t forthe  trial there was a deficiency in the number\\t of  personswho had been summoned and who appeared to act as  assessors,the  court then sent for Asharam whose name was in the\\tlistof  assessors  and ordered him to sit as an  assessor.\\t TheHigh  Court  took the view, and we think rightly,  that\\t thecircumstance that the formality of issuing a summons was notgone through was a mere irregularity which was curable undersection 537 of the Code, as there was no failure of  justicecaused on account of that irregularity and that the trial onthat  account could not be held to be bad.  This view is  inaccord with the decision of the Calcutta High Court in King-Emperor\\t v.  Ramsidh  Rai(1) with which we  agree.   We\\t areconstrained, however, to observe that the High Court did notfully  appreciate  the decision of the Patna High  Court  inBalak  Singh v. Emperor(2), when it said that that  decisionheld  a trial bad where a -person was chosen as an  assessorwho  had  not  been  summoned.\\t In  that  case\\t during\\t theexamination of the first witness only one qualified assessorwas  present  in court and capable of acting  as  such,\\t thejudge  ordered another person who happened to be present  incourt  but was not in the official list of assessors to\\t actas an(1) 30 Crl.

As observed by their Lordships of  the  PrivyCouncil in Subramania lyer v. -King-Emperor(\\'), disobedienceto  an\\texpress provision as to a mode of  trial  cannot  beregarded  as a mere irregularity.  In Abdul Rahman v.  King-Emperor (2), the distinction between cases which fall withinthe  rule of section 537 and those which are outside it\\t waspointed out by Lord Phillimore.\\t There it was said that\\t thedistinction  between  Suubramania Iyer\\'s case (1)  and\\tthatcase  in which there was an irregularity in  complying\\twiththe  provisions\\t of  section  360 of  the  Code\\t was  fairlyobvious.  In Subramania Iyer\\'s case(1) the procedure adoptedwas  one  which\\t the Code positively prohibits\\tand  it\\t waspossible that it might have worked actual injustice, to\\t theaccused but that the error in not reading the statements  ofwitnesses to them was of a different character, and such  anomission  was  not  fatal.  In Pulukurti  Kotayya  v.  King-Emperor(3)  their  Lordships again examined  this  question.That  was  a  case  where there had been  a  breach  of\\t theprovisions  of section 162, Criminal Procedure Code, and  itwas held that in the peculiar circumstances of that case  ithad  not prejudiced the accused and the case therefore\\tfellunder  section\\t537 and that the trial\\twas  valid  notwith-standing  the breach of section 162.  Sir John\\tBeaumont  indelivering  the\\t decision of the Board\\tmade  the  followingobservations which bring out the distinction between the twosets of cases:--\\nThere  are, no doubt, authorities in India which  lend\\tsomesupport to Mr. Pritt\\'s contention, and reference may be madeto  Tirkha  v. Nanak (4), in which the court  expressed\\t theview that section 537, Criminal Procedure Code, applied onlyto errors of procedure arising out of mere inadvertence, andnot to cases of disregard of, or disobedience to,  mandatoryprovisions of the Code, and to In re Madura Muthu(1) (1901) 28 l.A. 257.\\t     (3) (1947) 74 I.A. 65.(2) (1927) 54 I.A. 96.\\t    (4) (1927) I.L.R. 49 All- 475.\\nin which the view was expressed that any failureto examine the accused under section 342, Criminal ProcedureCode, was fatal to the validity of the trial, and could\\t notbe  cured under section 537.  In their\\tLordships\\'  opinion,this argument is based on too narrow a view of the operationof  section  537.   When a trial is conducted  in  a  mannerdifferent from that prescribed by the Code [as in Subramanialyer\\'s case(2)], the trial is bad, and no question of curingan  irregularity arises: but if the trial is conducted\\tsub-stantially  in the manner prescribed by the Code,  but\\tsomeirregularity  occurs  in  the course of\\t such  conduct,\\t theirregularity  can be cured under section 537, and  none\\t theless  so because the irregularity involves, as\\tmust  nearlyalways\\tbe  the case, a breach of one or more  of  the\\tverycomprehensive provisions of the Code.  The distinction drawnin  many of the cases in India between an illegality and  anirregularity  is  one of degree rather than of\\tkind.\\tThisview finds support in the decision of their Lordships\\' Boardin Abdul Rahman v. King-Emperor(\\'), where failure to  complywith  section 360, Criminal Procedure Code, was held  to  becured by sections 535 and 537.\\tThe present case falls undersection\\t 537,  and  their Lordships  hold  the\\ttrial  validnotwithstanding the breach of section 162.\"In our judgment, the trial conducted in the present case wasconducted in a manner different from that prescribed by\\t theCode  and is bad and no question here arises of\\t curing\\t anyirregularity.  The Code does not authorize a trial commencedwith  the aid of three named assessors to be  conducted\\t andcompleted with the aid of four assessors.  The\\tsubstitutionof one assessor by another and an addition to the number  ofassessors appointed at the commencement of the trial is\\t notsanctioned  by section 285, Criminal Procedure Code, nor  isit  authorized\\tby  section 284.  On  the  other  hand,\\t thelanguage  of  section  285(l) read with\\t the  provisions  ofsection 285(2) implicitly bans the holding of such a  trial.It is not possible to say with any degree(1)  (1922) I.L.R. 45 Mad. 82o.', '3': '(1927) 54 I.A. 96.\\nof certainty to what extent the opinion of the outgoing\\t andthe  incoming assessors who did not attend the whole of\\t thetrial  influenced the decision in the case ; but as  such  atrial  is unknown to law, it has to be presumed that it\\t wasillegal.', 'Mr': 'Mehta  for the State Government  contended\\t that  undersection\\t 309(2) the opinion of assessors is not\\t binding  onthe  sessions judge and their presence or absence  does\\t notaffect\\tthe  constitution of the court and that as  at\\tthistrial at least two of the assessors originally appointed satthroughout  the trial it should be held that the  trial\\t wassubstantially  a  trial\\t conducted in  accordance  with\\t theprovisions  of the Code.  The learned counsel did not go  tothe  length  of urging that a trial without the aid  of\\t anyassessors whatever was a good trial under the Code.  Such  acontention, if raised, would have to be negatived in view ofthe  clear provisions of section 284 and of sub-section\\t (2)of section 285.\\t The appointment of at least three assessorsis  essential for the validity of a trial of this  characterat  its commencement, and once validly commenced,in  certainevents, it can be validly concluded if at least one of\\tthemremains\\t present  throughout, while others drop out;  but  atrial  conducted in the manner in which it was done in\\tthiscase is wholly outside the contemplation of the Code and  itis  not possible to hold that it was concluded according  tothe provisions of the Code.  The provision in the Code\\tthatthe  opinion of the assessor is not binding on the  sessionsjudge  cannot  lend  support  to  the  contention  that\\t thesessions  judge is entitled to ignore their very  existence.As already pointed out, though he may not be bound to accepttheir  opinions,  be is certainly bound to  take  them\\tintoconsideration.\\t The weight to be attached to such  opinionsmay well vary with the number of assessors.Mr.  Mehta to support his contention placed reliance on\\t themajority  decision of the Madras High Court in\\tKing-Emperorv. Tirumal Reddi (1).  In that case the trial continued\\t forabout seven weeks.  During that(1)  (1901) I.L.R. 24 Mad. 523.\\nperiod one of the assessors was permitted to absent  himselfduring\\ttwo whole days, and five half days respectively,  atfirst,\\tso that he might visit his mother on her  death-bed,and  subsequently, to perform the daily\\t obsequies  renderednecessary  by her decease.  He then resumed his seat  as  anassessor  and continued so to act until the  termination  ofthe  trial,  all  the depositions recorded  in\\this  absencehaving been read by him on his return.\\tAt the conclusion ofthe  trial  the sessions judge invited the opinion  of\\teachassessor, and recorded it.  The opinion of each was that allthe  accused  were guilty and the judge concurring  in\\tthatopinion, convicted. the accused.  On appeal it was contendedthat  the  judge had acted contrary to law in  allowing\\t theassessor  who  had  been absent to resume  his\\tseat  as  anassessor  and in inviting and taking into consideration\\t hisopinion\\t in deciding the case.\\tIt was held by the  majorityof  the\\t court that the finding and  the  sentence  appealedagainst had been passed by a court of competent jurisdictionwithin\\tthe meaning of section 537 of the Code and that\\t thedefect\\tin  the trial did not affect its  validity  and\\t wascured  by that section as the irregularity had not  in\\tfactoccasioned a failure of justice.  Mr. Justice Davies took  adifferent  view.   This decision was clearly  given  on\\t thepeculiar  facts\\t and circumstances of that case\\t and  is  noauthority in support of the view contended for by Mr. Mehta.For the reasons given above we are constrained to hold\\tthatthe  trial of the appellants conducted in the  manner  abovestated\\twas  bad and the appellants have to  be\\t retried  inaccordance with the procedure prescribed by the Code.In  the result we allow this appeal, quash  tile  convictionand  sentence  passed on the appellants,  and  direct  theirretrial\\t by  the  sessions  judge  in  accordance  with\\t theprocedure prescribed by the Code.\\nAppeal\\tallowed Retrial ordered.\\nAgent for the respondent: G.

P. Naik, Police Inspector, Anti-Corruption Branch, Belgaum, in order that he should help them in getting the income-tax inquiry against them dropped and that he should see that the account-books attached by the Anti-Corruption Police were returned to them and having thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 116 read with Sections 161 and 34, Penal Code. The prosecution case was as follows: The appellants and one Madivalappa Veerappa Pattan were residing and carrying on business in partnership in Silk, Yarn, Sarees and other articles in Rabkavi in the district of Belgaum. Having received information that the firm was evading income-tax to a great extent, one Sri Gudi, the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti-Corruption Branch, along with Sri Naik, Inspector of Police, went from Belgaum to Rabkavi and searched the residence and business premises of the appellants on 24th/25th-1-1949 and seized their account-books. At this time the appellant Durdi offered to pay RS. 15,000 to RS. 20,000 to Sri Naik to hush up the matter. A similar offer was also made to Sri Gudi. Both the officers characterised the offer as improper and declined to accept it. The two officers returned to Belgaum on 26-1-1949 and on their return they informed their superior officers Sri Malpathak, the Superintendent of Police and Sri Wagh, the then head of the Anti-Corruption Branch about the offers of bribe made to them by the appellants. They also had a talk about these offers with Shri Jadhav, the District Magistrate of Belgaum who advised them to arrange for a trap to catch the appellants. On 21-2-1949 Shri Gudi issued an order (EX. 1A) directing Sri Naik to examine the books of account attached by them and to submit his report. In the first week of March 1949 at Hubli, which was about 100 miles away from Rabkavi, the appellants contacted one Sri Keshavain who was known to them and was also a friend of Sri Naik and through him offered to pay Sri Naik an amount up to RS. 30,000 for saving them from the enquiry and for the return of the books of account. Sri Keshavain later on informed them that he had seen Sri Naik but the latter had asked him to inform the appellants that the offer was an improper one. On 12-3-1949 Sri Naik submitted his report (EX. 10A) stating in substance that a cursory examination revealed that huge profits made by black marketing had been concealed and the payment of income-tax on such profits had been evaded. The report ended with the following paragraph :'}", "subPara": "{'\"9': 'I have not examined the other account-books attached. This examination of mine was very cursory. If a detailed and careful examination is made along with secret papers balance sheets and other important documents by an expert the profits made by Mr. Durdi for remaining 7 years might come several lacs. So I submit that the A.A.I.G.P., A.O., Poona, may please be moved in the matter to send the books to the Commissioner of Income-tax for further disposal.\"\\nIn the second week of March 1949, the appellants again requested Sri Keshavain to try again and renew the offer to Sri Naik. In the meantime Sri Naik informed Sri Gudi about the offer made through Sri Keshavain and Sri Gudi advised Sri Naik to consent to accept the amount with a view to trap the appellants. Accordingly, when Sri Keshavain renewed the offer to Sri Naik, the latter told him that if the appellants came with the money to Belgaum he (Sri Naik) would see to the rest of things. This reply of Sri Naik was conveyed by Sri Keshavain to the appellants. On 22-3-1949 the appellants and the deceased Pattan saw Sri Keshavain at Hubli and said that they would like to hand over the money personally to Sri Naik and requested Sri Keshavain to accompany them to Belgaum which the latter agreed to do. Accordingly, on 23-3-1949 the appellants and Pattan and Sri Keshavain came to Belgaum. Sri Keshavain then arranged for their meeting with Sri Naik at 7 to 7-30 P. M. near Mitra Samaj. Sri Naik kept Sri Gudi informed as to what had happened. At the appointed time Sri Naik went near the Mitra Samaj and met the appellants and Sri Keshavain. The appellants requested Sri Naik to accept the money but Sri Naik said that matters of this kind should not be discussed on the public road and asked them to see him in his room at the Police Club at 10 to 10-30 p. M. Sri Naik informed Sri Gudi about this appointment. Sri Gudi asked Sri Naik to submit a report in writing which the latter did (EX. 1-B). Sri Naik and Sri Gudi then went to the District Magistrate Sri Jadhav who, not being able to be present in person at the time of the trapping, wrote a D. O. (EX. 3A) to Sri Kamat, the Additional Magistrate, to witness the trapping. Sri Jadhav also authorised Sri Gudi to investigate into the offence by making an endorsement on Sri Naik\\'s report (EX. 1-B). Then Sri Gudi and Sri Naik returned to the Police Club where Sri Arur, Sub-Inspector, and the Panchas were waiting. Sri Gudi also brought Sri Kamat to the Police Club. A Panchnama (EX. 2A) about the search of the room and of the person of Sri Naik was made by Sri Gudi in the presence of the Panchas and Sri Kamat. Then the party left the room and concealed themselves, leaving Sri Naik alone in the room waiting for the arrival of the appellants.\\nAt about 10-30 P. M. the appellants and Pattan entered the room of Sri Naik. After receiving them and offering them seats Sri Naik asked the appellants as to what he could do for them. The appellant Gunaki told him that they should be saved from the income-tax inquiry and that their books of account should be returned to them. The appellant Durdi also made similar requests. Thereafter, on a signal from the appellant Gunaki, the appellant Durdi handed over a bundle wrapped in cloth to Sri Naik who opened it and found that it contained bundles of currency notes. Sri Naik kept the notes on the cot where he was sitting and the appellant Gunaki then wanted the return of the unstamped Sarees which had been seized. He also enquired as to when the books would be returned. Sri Naik said that the sanction of the Magistrate would be necessary before the books could be returned. The appellant Gunaki then said that the balance amount would be paid on receipt of the books. At this stage Sri Naik signalled to Sri Gudi through the window and the latter with his party including Sri Kamat rushed into the room. Sri Naik handed over the bundles of notes to them and the formalities of drawing up a Panchnama were gone through.'}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'2': \"After some further investigation, in the course of which Madivalappa Veerappa Pattan the partner of the appellants died, the two appellants were sent up for trial on the charge mentioned above.

The appellants moved the High Court in revision but that application was also dismissed. The appellants applied for and obtained leave of the High Court to appeal to this Court on a certificate under Article 134(1) which runs as follows :\\n\"Leave applied for granted inasmuch as the case is principally decided upon the view that, when the offerer of a bribe is prosecuted, the question to be considered is whether he gave the bribe with a view to corrupt the Government servant.

R. Ambedkar appearing in support of this appeal contends on the authority of certain observations to be found in H.T. Huntley v. Emperor,  (A) that the prosecution had not excluded every reasonable possibility of innocence of the appellants. The accused in that case was convicted by a Special Tribunal from whose decision there was no appeal. There was only an application for revision to the High Court which dismissed that revision petition but granted a certificate under Section 205(1), Government of India Act, 1935. There was, therefore, no question of there being concurrent finding by two Courts entitled to go into questions of facts such as there is in the case before us. Further, as it will be presently seen, the facts relied on by the learned counsel only have a bearing on the question of appreciation of the evidence. Thus, it is said that although there was a definite allegation of the alleged offer of bribe made by the appellants to the two police officers on 24/25-1-1949 and although the two police officers informed their superior officers and the latter advised the trapping of the appellants nothing was done for two months and it is concluded from such inaction that no bribe had in fact been offered and that this story was, therefore, false. We see no force in this argument, because the police authorities had per force to wait until the appellants made a further move in the matter. It is not reasonable to suggest that the police authorities should go out of their way and actively invite bribes in order to trap the appellants. In the next place it is said that although Sri Naik in his report dated 12-3-1949 suggested that there had been evasion of tax on a large scale there was really no substance in such report for the additional tax eventually demanded was a paltry sum of RS. 71-8-0 for the year 1945-1946 and a sum of RS. 63-11-0 for the year 1946-1947 and it is suggested that it cannot be believed that the appellants would, in such circumstances, be prepared to pay a bribe up to Rs. 30 000 or even a bribe of RS. 15,000. The fact that RS. 15,000 was offered is not disputed. The argument is that it is highly improbable that the appellants would offer a bribe of Rs. 15,000 when they knew that a very small sum was due on account of income-tax. The self-same argument would make it equally improbable that the appellants knowing that the amount of income-tax payable was very small would be prepared to offer Rs. 15,000 as and by way of composition for the income-tax liability. In the third place it is said that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to what was actually said when the money was paid is not consistent. Our attention has been drawn to the different statements made by the prosecution witnesses Sri Naik, Sri Areer, Sri Keshavain, the Panch and Sri Kamat but we do not find any substantial discrepancy in their statements. Finally it is urged that as the appellants were taking steps by means of applications to the higher authorities for the return of their books which fact indicated that they knew that the proper authority to release the books was the District Magistrate, there could, therefore, be no reason for their offering a bribe to Sri Gudi or Sri Naik who had not got it in their power to return the books without the sanction of the District Magistrate. It was reasonably clear that before the District Magistrate would pass any order on the appellants' application for return of the books he would consult the officers at whose instance the books had been attached--as, in fact, the District Magistrate did in this case--and the appellants may, therefore, have thought that a favourable report from Sri Gudi or Sri Naik would facilitate their obtaining an order for return of their books. As already stated, the concurrent findings of fact by the trial Magistrate as well as by the Additional Sessions Judge in appeal are against the appellants and we do not consider that the several points advanced by the learned counsel as hereinbefore mentioned constitute a sufficient ground for departing from the ordinary practice of this Court to accept the concurrent findings of fact as correct.\"}", "subPara": "{}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'5': 'Dr. Ambedkar then submits that in this case no offence had been committed He points out that it was Sri Gudi and not Sri Naik who was authorised to seize the books. Sri Gudi directed Sri Naik to examine the books and make a report which the latter did on 12-3-1949, EX. 10-A. After that date Sri Naik was functus officio, having fully performed whatever duty he had to perform, and, therefore, he was not the public servant who could, in the exercise of his official function, show any favour or render any service to the appellants. Learned counsel relied on the cases of Shamsul Huq v. Emperor, A.I.R. 1921 Cal 344 (B), In re P. Venkiah, A.I.R. 1924 Mad. 851 (c) and Venkatarama Naidu v. Emperor, A. I. R. 1929 Mad. 756 (D).

State, (j) and State v. Sadhuacharan Panigrahi, . The point of law appears to have been more fully discussed in these cases and the reasonings set out therein appear to us, as at present advised to be more convincing than those set out in the cases relied on by Dr. Ambedkar. It is, however, not necessary for the purposes of this case, to express any final opinion on this question, for we are satisfied, on the facts of this case, that Sri Gudi and Sri Naik had it in their power, in the exercise of their official functions, to show favour or render some service to the appellants. It will be remembered that the report of Sri Naik was in the nature of a tentative report made on a cursory examination of the books of account. The books of account were still in their custody and the matter was 3till under their investigation. In fact, the District Magistrate had on 20-3-1949 referred the application of the appellants for the return of the books to Sri Gudi for report. Sri Gudi made his report thereon on 25-3-1949 stating that the investigation was in progress and the books were heavy and that he would inform the District Magistrate as soon as the books would not be required any more. The offer of bribe, as already indicated, was last made to Sri Naik on 23-3-1949. On that date there was nothing to prevent Sri Naik from making a further report stating that on closer scrutiny of the books of account he found there was no tax evasion and there was nothing to prevent Sri Gudi from reporting to the District Magistrate that the books were not required and could be returned. In view of these facts the decisions in the three cases relied on by Dr. Ambedkar can have no application even if they were well-founded in principle. The contention of Dr. Ambedkar, therefore, must be rejected.'}", "subPara": "{}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'6': 'Finally, Dr. Ambedkar urges that the sentence should be reduced, particularly as regards appellant 2.

The appeal isconfined to survey No. 86/2 at Mundhava in Poona district.The principal question arising for decision in the ap.\\tpealis whether notice as contemplated by section III (g) of\\t theTransfer of Property Act is necessary for the  determinationof a lease for non-payment of rent even where such lease wasexecuted  before  the coming into force of the\\tTransfer  ofProperty  Act.\\t The  only other  question  that  falls\\t fordetermination\\tis  whether  the  High\\tCourt  should\\thaveinterfered  with  the  discretion of  the  lower  courts  inrefusing  relief against forfeiture in the circumstances  ofthis case.\\nThe  present respondents are the daughter and grand sons  ofthe original plaintiff Vinayakbhat.  His adoptive mother wasRamabai.   She owned two inam lands at Mundhava\\t which\\twerethen  numbered Pratibhandi Nos. 71 and 72.   Present  surveyNos.  86/1 and 86/2 together correspond to  old\\t PratibhandiNo.  71.   On  1st July, 1863, Ramabai,\\t while\\tshe  was  infinancial  difficulties,  passed a permanent lease  of\\tboththese numbers to one Ladha Ibrahim Sheth.  The lessee paid apremium of Rs. 999 for the lease, and also agreed to pay1011a  yearly rent of Rs. 80 to Ramabai during her lifetime\\t andafter  her death a yearly amount equal to the assessment  ofthe  two lands to the heirs of Ramabai.\\t The lease  providedthat in default of payment of rent the tenant\\'s rights wouldcome  to an end.- On 18th August, 1870, Ladha  Ibrahim\\tsoldhis  tenancy  rights to one Girdhari Balaram Lodhi  for\\t Rs.7,999.\\tThe sale deed provided that in default of payment ofrent  to Ramabai or her heirs, the purchaser would  have  norights\\twhatsoever left over the property.  On the same\\t daythe purchaser passed a rent note in favour of Ramabai.\\t Therent note provided for the payment of the agreed rent in themonth  of  Pousb  every year, and stated  that\\tin  case  ofdefault the tenant or his heirs would have no right over theland.\\tDefendant  No. 1 and the other\\tdefendants  are\\t thegrandsons of Seth Girdhari Balaram.\\nIn spite of the nullity clause in the lease it appears\\tthatthe lessee has been more or less a habitual defaulter in thepayment\\t of rent.  In the year 1913, rent for six years\\t wasin  arrears.  Vinayakbhat filed Suit No. 99 of 1913  in\\t thecourt of the II Class Sub-Judge, Poona, against the  presentdefendants  for\\t possession of the demised premises  on\\t theground\\tof forfeiture.\\tA number of defences were raised  bythem.  Inter alia, it was pleaded that as no notice had beengiven  to  them the forfeiture was not\\tenforceable.   Thesecontentions  were  negatived but the  court  granted  reliefagainst\\t forfeiture.   Defendant No. 1 was a minor  at\\tthattime and became a major in or about 1925.\\nIn  the year 1928 again rent for two years was\\tin  arrears.Vinayakbhat  filed  Civil Suit No. 258 of 1928\\tagainst\\t thepresent\\t  defendants  for  possession  on  the\\t ground\\t  offorfeiture.    The   plaintiff\\t subsequently\\twaived\\t theforfeiture by accepting three years\\' rent which by then\\t hadfallen in arrears and costs of the suit.\\nIn  the\\t year  1931 rent for three  years  again  fell\\tintoarrears.   The amount was then sent by money order  and\\t thelandlord accepted it.\\nIn the year 1934 again rent for three years remained unpaid.At that time proceedings were started by Government for\\t theacquisition of the old survey No. 72.\\nThe  landlord  claimed\\tthat he was entitled  to  the  wholecompensation  money  as the tenant\\'s rights  had  ceased  byforfeiture for non-payment of rent.  Defendant No. 1 throughhis  pleader sent a notice to Vinayakbhat to come  and\\ttakethe arrears of rent.  \\'He agreed and accepted the arrears ofrent  and the forfeiture was again waived.  As a  result  ofthis  the defendants got Rs. 32,000 by way  of\\tcompensationfor the permanent tenancy rights in old survey No. 72, whileVinayakbhat   got  Rs.\\t1,400  for  compensation   for\\t theacquisition of his rights as landlord in that land.In   1938  rent\\t for  four  years  was\\tagain  in   arrears.Vinayakbhat filed Civil Suit No. 982 of 1938 in the court ofthe  I\\tClass  Sub-Judge at Poona against  all\\tthe  presentdefendants  for possession of survey Nos. 86/1 and  86/2  onthe  ground that the lease had determined by forfeiture\\t fornon-payment  of rent.  In that suit defendant No. 1  pleadedthat  there was no forfeiture because no rent was  fixed  inrespect\\t of  the suit property and also because it  was\\t forthe, plaintiff to recover rent and not for the defendants togo  to\\tthe plaintiff and pay it.   These  contentions\\twerenegatived.   It\\t was held that forfeiture had  occurred\\t butrelief against forfeiture was again granted.On  plaintiff\\'s\\t appeal in this case, the  learned  DistrictJudge refused to interfere with the discretion of the  trialjudge  in  granting relief against forfeiture  but  observedthat   the   defendants\\t having\\t obtained   relief   againstforfeiture  thrice before should not expect to get it for  afourth\\ttime  if they again make default in the\\t payment  ofrent.\\nThe  default  which  has  given rise  to  the  present\\tsuitoccurred on 28th January, 1941, and the plaintiff filed\\t thesuit  out of which this appeal arises for possession on\\t theground\\tof  forfeiture\\tand for the arrears  of\\t rent  whichremained unpaid.  It was alleged in the plaint that the rentdue  on 28th January, 1941, was not paid,  though  demanded.Plaintiff asked for possession of survey Nos. 86/1 and\\t86/2after  removal of the structures thereon.  Defendant  No.  1pleaded\\t that as a result of partition rights in survey\\t No.86/2 had fallen to1013his  share, that according to the terms of the rent note  itwas  for the plaintiff to approach the defendants  and.\\t notfor  the  defendants to go to the plaintiff and\\t pay  it,\\'-\\'that as the plaintiff did not approach the defendants and nodemand\\tfor  rent  was made, no\\t forfeiture  occurred,\\tthatdefendant No. I did offer the rent to the plaintiff, but theplaintiff  fraudulently\\t refused  to  accept  it,  that\\t theplaintiff ought to have sent a notice according to law if hewanted\\tto enforce the right of forfeiture and that  withoutprejudice  to  the above contentions he\\t should\\t be  grantedrelief against forfeiture.\\nThe  trial court decreed the plaintiff\\'s suit and  negativedthe  contentions  raised  by the  defendants.\\tIn  awardingPossession of the entire property to the plaintiff the trialcourt  imposed\\ta  condition that  defendant  No.  I  shouldcontinue to be in possession of the two structures in surveyNo.  86/2  till\\t the end of March, 1950.   On  the  questionwhether\\t a  notice was necessary before the lease  could  beterminated,  the  trial court expressed the  view  that\\t theprovision  in the rent note that on non-payment of rent\\t therights\\tof the tenant would come to an end was a  clause  ofnullity\\t and not merely a clause of forfeiture and that\\t thelease was therefore determined under section 111 (b) and notunder  section III (g) of the Transfer of Property  Act\\t andthat no notice as required by section 111 (g) was  necessaryfor  terminating  the lease in suit.  On the  issue  whetherforfeiture should be relieved against, the trial court\\tsaidthat  relief  could have been given to\\tthe  lessee  againstforfeiture  under section 1 14 had it not been for the\\tfactthat the defendants had disentitled themselves to relief  bycontumacious  conduct on their part, that even\\tthis  paltryrent  had  never been paid in time during  the\\tlast  twentyyears  at  any\\trate, and that after  defendant\\t No.  I\\t hadattained majority and got the estate in his charge in  1922-23  he\\thad uniformly defaulted in the payment of  rent\\t andthat  the  defendants raised totally false defences  and  inevery  suit  a\\tfalse excuse was set up\\t in  an\\t attempt  tojustify the arrears of rent.\\nIn  pursuance  of the trial court\\'s  decree  plaintiff\\ttookpossession of all the suit lands in April, 1943, except\\t oneacre  which  he\\t took possession on  13th  September,  1943.Defendant No. I remained in possession of the two structureson survey No. 86/2.  Against the decision of the trial judgedefendant No. I-alone filed an appeal to the District  Judgeof Poona.  The lower appellate court confirmed the decree ofthe trial court with two modifications.\\t Defendant No. I wasallowed to remove the buildings on survey No. 86/2 and\\talsothe trees therein within three months.\\tOn the issue whethera  notice was necessary, the appellate court found that\\t thelease  came  to an end not under section  111(b)  but  undersection\\t 111 (g) of the Transfer of Pro perty Act, but\\tthatno notice of forfeiture was necessary as the lease had\\tbeenexecuted  prior to the coming into force of the Transfer  ofProperty  Act.\\tThe appellate court saw no valid reason\\t forinterfering  with  the\\tfinding of the trial  judge  on\\t thequestion concerning relief against forfeiture.From  this appellate decree defendant No. I filed  a  secondappeal\\tto  the\\t High Court of Judicature  at  Bombay.\\t Theplaintiff filed cross-objections in regard to the trees\\t andcosts.\\tThe High Court dismissed the appeal and allowed\\t thecross-objections.   An\\tapplication was made  for  leave  toappeal\\tto  the\\t Supreme  Court\\t and  it  was  granted\\twithreference to survey -No. 86/2.\\nThe  law  with\\tregard to the determination of\\ta  lease  byforfeiture  is contained is section III (g) of the  Transferof Property Act.  Under that provision a lease is determinedby forfeiture in case the lessee breaks an express conditionwhich  provides\\t that on breach thereof the lessor  may\\t re-enter, or in case the lessee renounces his character as suchby setting up a title in a third person or by claiming titlein  himself, or the lessee is adjudicated an  insolvent\\t andthe  lease  provides  that the lessor  may  reenter  on\\t thehappening of such event and a certain further act is done bythe   lessor  as  thereinafter\\tmentioned.   Prior  to\\t itsamendment  by  Act  XX of  1929,  this\\tsub-section  furtherprovided1015\"And in any of these cases the lessor or his transferee doessome act showing his intention to determine the lease.\"By  Act\\t XX  of 1929, this subsection was  amended  and\\t theamended sub-section now reads:-\\n\"And  in  any of these cases the lessor\\t or  his  transfereegives  notice in writing to the lessee of his  intention  todetermine the lease.\"\\nSection\\t 111 (g) in terms makes the further act an  integralcondition  of the forfeiture.  In other words, without\\tthisact there is no completed forfeiture at all.  Under the\\t oldsection an overt act evidencing the requisite intention\\t wasessential.  As the law stands today under the Act, notice inwriting\\t by  the  landlord is a\\t condition  precedent  to  aforfeiture and the right of re-entry.  Section 63 of Act  XXof  1929,  restricts  the operation  of\\t this  amendment  totransfers of property made after 1st April, 1930.  The leasein  this case was executed before the Transfer\\tof  PropertyAct  came into force in 1882.  The amendment therefore\\tmadein   this   sub-section\\t by  Act  XX  of  1929\\t not   beingretrospective, cannot touch the present lease and it is alsoexcluded  from the reach of the Transfer of Property Act  bythe provisions of section 2. The position was not  seriouslydisputed  in the High Court or before us that the  statutoryprovisions  of\\tsection\\t 111(g) as such cannot\\tbe  made  togovern\\tthe  present lease which was executed  in  the\\tyear1870.\\tIt  was however strongly argued that  the  amendmentmade  in  1929\\tto  section 111(g) of  the  Act\\t embodies  aprinciple  of  justice,\\t equity\\t and  good  conscience\\t andnotwithstanding\\t section  2 of the Act, that  principle\\t wasapplicable  in\\tthis  case and there can  be  no  forfeitureunless\\tnotice in writing to the lessee of his intention  todetermine the lease by the lessor bad been given.It is axiomatic that the courts must apply the principles ofjustice,  equity and good conscience to\\t transactions  whichcome  up  before  them for  determination  even\\t though\\t thestatutory provisions of the Transfer of1016Property Act are not made applicable to these  transactions.It  follows therefore that the provisions of the  Act  whichare  but  a statutory recognition of the rules\\tof  justice,equity\\t\\'and  good conscience also govern  those  transfers.If,   therefore,  we  are  satisfied  that  the\\t  particularprinciple  to which the legislature has now given effect  bythe  amendment\\tto section 111 (g) did in fact\\trepresent  aprinciple   of\\t justice,  equity   and\\t  good\\t conscience,undoubtedly  the case will have to be decided in  accordancewith the rule laid down in the section, although in  expressterms  it  has not been made applicable to  leases  executedprior to 1929 or even prior to the Transfer of Property\\t Actcoming into force.\\nThe  main  point  for consideration - thus  is\\twhether\\t theparticular  provision  introduced  in  sub-section  (g)\\t  ofsection 111 of the Transfer of Property Act in 1929 is but astatutory recognition of a principle of justice, equity\\t andgood  conscience, or whether it is merely a  procedural\\t andtechnical rule introduced in the section by the\\t legislatureand  is\\t not  based on any well\\t established  principles  ofequity.\\t  The  High Court held, and we think  rightly,\\tthatthis  provision in sub-section (g) of section III in  regardto  notice  was\\t not based upon any  principle\\tof  justice,equity and good conscience.  In the first instance it may beobserved  that\\tit  is\\terroneous  to  suppose\\tthat   everyprovision  in  the  Transfer  of  Property  Act\\t and   everyamendment  effected  is necessarily based on  principles  ofjustice,  equity and good conscience.  It has to be seen  inevery  case  whether the particular provisions\\tof  the\\t Actrelied upon restates a known rule of equity or whether it ismerely\\ta  new\\trule laid down by  the\\tlegislature  withoutreference to any rule of equity and what is the true  natureand  character of the rule.  Now, so far as section 111\\t (g)of  the\\t Act is concerned, the insistence therein  that\\t thenotice\\tshould be given in writing is intrinsic evidence  ofthe  fact  that\\t the formality is merely  statutory  and  itcannot trace its origin to any rule of equity.\\tEquity\\tdoesnot  concern itself with mere forms or modes  of  procedure.If  the purpose of the rule as to notice is to indicate\\t theintention of the lessor to1017determine  the\\tlease and to avail himself of  the  tenant\\'sbreach of covenant it could as effectively be achieved by anoral  intimation  as  by a written one without\\tin  any\\t waydisturbing the mind of a chancery judge.  The requirement asto  written notice provided in the section therefore  cannotbe said to be based on any general rule of equity.  That  itis  not\\t so  is\\t apparent from\\tthe  circumstance  that\\t therequirement of a notice in writing to complete a  forfeiturehas  been  dispensed with by the legislature in\\t respect  toleases\\texecuted before 1st April, 1930.  Those\\t leases\\t arestill governed by the unamended sub-section (g) of section 11 1. All that was required by that sub-section was that\\t thelessor\\twas to show his intention to determine the lease  bysome  act  indicating  that intention.\\t The  principles  ofjustice, equity and good conscience are not such a  variablecommodity,   that  they\\t change\\t and  stand  altered  on   aparticular  date on the mandate of the legislature and\\tthatto leases made between 1882 and 1930 the principle of equityapplicable  is\\tthe one contained in sub-section (g)  as  itstood  before 1929, and to leases executed after 1st  April,1930, the principle of equity is the one stated in the\\tsub-section\\t as  it\\t now stands.  Question may  also  be  posed,whether\\t according  to English law a notice is\\ta  necessaryrequisite to complete a forfeiture.\\nThe  English law on the subject is stated in  Foa\\'s  GeneralLaw  of\\t Landlord and Tenant (7th edition) at  page  316  inthese terms :-\\n\"  In no case can the lessee take advantage of\\tthe  provisofor  re-entry in order to avoid the lease, even where it  isin the form (not that the lessor may reenter, but) that\\t theterm  shall cease, or that the lease shall be void  for\\t allpurposes, or \\'absolutely forfeited\\'; for expressions of thiskind  only  mean  that the tenancy shall  determine  at\\t theoption\\t of  the  lessor.........  This\\t has  been   usuallyexpressed by saying that the lease is voidable and not void;but  the  true principle appears to be that the\\t lease\\tdoesbecome\\tvoid  to all intents and purposes,  though  this  issubject\\t to the condition that the party who is\\t seeking  toset up its invalidity1321018is not himself in default, for otherwise he would be  takingadvantage  of  his  own wrong.\\tIt follows  that  where\\t theproviso makes the lease void, the landlord must, in order totake  advantage of it, do some unequivocal act\\tnotified  tothe lessee, indicating his intention to avail himself of theoption\\tgiven  to  him.\\t  The service  upon  the  lessee  inpossession of a writ in ejectment is sufficient\".The   Law  of  Property\\t Act,  1925,  by  section  146\\t hasconsolidated  the  law\\tin England  on\\tthis  subject.\\t Theprovision with regard to the giving of notice before a rightof re-entry accrues to the landlord is expressly excluded bysub-section (11) in cases of re-entry on forfeiture for non-payment of rent.  In England it is not necessary in case  ofnon-payment  of rent for a landlord to give notice before  aforfeiture results.  It cannot, therefore, be said that whathas  been  enacted in sub-section (g) of section II 1  is  amatter\\twhich even today in English law is considered  as  amatter\\tof justice, equity and good conscience.\\t In  Englishlaw  the  bringing  of an action which\\tcorresponds  to\\t theinstitution  of\\t a suit in India is itself an act  which  isdefinitely  regarded as evidencing an intention on the\\tpartof  the\\t lessor to determine a lease with  regard  to  whichthere has been a breach of covenant entitling the lessor  tore-enter  : vide Toleman v. Portbury and Prakashchandra\\t Dasv. Rajendranath Basu(2).\\nIn  India there is a substantial body of judicial  authorityfor  the proposition that in respect of leases\\tmade  beforethe  Transfer  of Property Act forfeiture is  incurred\\twhenthere  is a disclaimer of title or there is  non-payment  ofrent.\\tAny subsequent act of the landlord electing to\\ttakeadvantage  of a forfeiture is not a condition  precedent  tothe  right  of\\taction for ejectment.\\tThe  bringing  by  alandlord  of  a\\t suit  for ejectment is\\t simply\\t a  mode  ofmanifesting  his  election.  The principle  of\\tthese  casesrests  upon the ground that the forfeiture is complete\\twhenthe  breach of the condition or the denial of title  occurs.But  as it is left to the lessor\\'s option to take  advantageof it or not, the(1)  L.R. 6 Q.B. 245.(2) (1931)58 cal. 1359.\\nelection is not a condition precedent to the right of actionand   the  institution\\tof  the\\t action\\t is   a\\t  sufficientmanifestation  of  the\\telection.   The\\t same  principle  isapplied for actions for relief on the ground of fraud. [videPadmabhaya  v. Ranga(1) ; Korapalu v. Narayana(2)]. In\\tRamaAiyangar v. Guruswami Chetty(3),it was saidthat as the leasewas  not  governed  by the Transfer  of\\t Property  Act,\\t theinstitution  of the suit was a sufficient  determination  ofthe  lease  and no other previous act determining  the\\tsamesuch  as a notice to quit was necessary for maintaining\\t theaction.\\t  The  same view was expressed\\tin  Venkatachari  v.Rangaswami  Aiyar(4).\\tIn Venkatarama Aiyar  v.  PonnuswamiPadayachi(5),  it was observed that the forfeiture will\\t notbe  produced  merely  by the unilateral act  of\\t ceasing  tocomply with the conditions upon which the property is  held,but  it\\t must involve also some expression of  intention  toenforce the forfeiture on the part of the lessor.  In  otherwords, the lessee cannot by his unilateral act terminate thelease, and cannot take advantage of his own wrong.  That  isan intelligible principle and is based on a maxim of equity.But  the  defaulting lessee cannot claim the  benefit  of  anotice\\tin  writing  to\\t complete  the\\tforfeiture  he\\t hasincurred.   The\\t lessor has to simply express  an  intentionthat he is going to avail of the forfeiture and that can  bedone  by  the filing of a suit, as in English  law,  in\\t allcases not governed by the Transfer of Property Act.Again  in Ramakrishna Mallaya v. Baburaya (6), it  was\\tsaidthat in an ejectment suit based on leases executed prior  tothe  Transfer  of Property Act, no act on the  part  of\\t thelandlord  showing that he elected to take advantage  of\\t theforfeiture  for\\t non-payment  of rent  was  necessary.\\t Thecontrary  view\\texpressed  in  Nourang\\tSingh  v.   JanardanKishor(7),  that  the institution of a\\tsuit  for  ejectmentcould  not  be\\tregarded  as a requisite  act  to  show\\t theintention of a(1)  (1911) I,L.R. 34 Mad. 161.', '2': 'A.I.R. 1928 Mad. 250.', '3': '[1912] A.C. 623.\\nan  application\\t for  relief.  But I think it  ought  to  bedistinctly  understood that there may be cases in which\\t anyor all of them may be disregarded.  If it were otherwise thefree  discretion given by the statute would be\\tfettered  bylimitations  which  have nowhere been enacted.\\t It  is\\t onething  to  decide what is the true meaning of  the  languagecontained in an Act of Parliament.  It is quite a  differentthing  to place conditions upon a free discretion  entrustedby  statute to the court where the conditions are not  basedupon  statutory enactment at all.  It is not safe, I  think,to  say\\t that  the court must and will\\talways\\tinsist\\tuponcertain\\t things when the Act does not require them, and\\t thefacts of some unforeseen case may make the court wish it hadkept a free hand.\"\\nWith  great  respect we think that  the\\t observations  citedabove  contain sound principles of law.\\t We are,  therefore,unable\\tto  accede to the contention of\\t Mr.  Daphtary\\tthatthough section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act confers adiscretion  on\\tthe court, that discretion except  in  caseswhere  third  party  interests\\tintervene  must\\t always\\t  beexercised  in  favour  of the  tenant  irrespective  of\\t theconduct\\t of the tenant.\\t It is clear that in this  case\\t thetenant is a recalcitrant tenant and is a habitual defaulter.For the best part of 25 years he has never paid rent withoutbeing sued in court.  Rent has been in arrears at times\\t forsix years, at other times for three years and at other timesfor four years and so on, and every time the landlord had tofile a suit in ejectment which was always resisted on  falsedefences.  No rule of equity, justice or good conscience canbe invoked in the case of a tenant of this description.\\t  Hecannot always be allowed to take advantage of his own  wrongand  to plead relief against forfeiture on  every  occasion,particularly when he was warned by the court of appeal on  aprevious occasion.  He had already had relief three times onequitable grounds and it is time that the court withheld itshands and ordered his ejectment.  In this situation the HighCourt  was fully justified in finding that in second  appealit would not interfere with the1028discretion    of  the courts  below  in\\t refusing  to, grantrelief against forfeiture.\\nThe result therefore is that this appeal fails is  dismissedwith costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\nAgent for  appellant: R.A.

Abbas  Bandi  Bibi\\t(1),which concerned the provisions of section 10 of the Transferof  Property Act which recognizes the validity of a  partialrestriction  upon  a power of disposition in the case  of  atransfer  inter\\t vivos.\\t  It  was held\\tthat  there  was  noauthority that a different principle applied in India beforethe  Act  was passed and that under English  law  a  partialrestriction  was\\'  not\\trepugnant  even in  the\\t case  of  atestamentary gift.\\nLastly,\\t Mr. Daphtary drew our attention to the decision  inRoberts\\t v. Davey(2), which relates to a licence.  There  itwas observed that it was necessary for the licensor to\\thavedone some act showing his intention to determine the licenceand  until  such  act  was shown,  it  continued  in  force.Littledale  J. in this case said that the instrument was  \"amere  licence to dig, and did not pass the land.  An  actualentry,\\ttherefore,  was\\t unnecessary to\\t avoid\\tit;  but  byanalogy to what is required to be done in order to determinea freehold lease which, by the terms of it, is to be void onthe  non-performance of covenants, it seems to follow  that,to put an end to this licence, the grantor should have givennotice\\tof  his\\t intention  so to do\".\\t The  basis  of\\t thedecision  was that some act amounting to an exercise of\\t theoption\\thad to be proved before the licence was\\t determined.This  decision\\ttherefore  does not in any  way\\t affect\\t thedecision of the High Court in this case.\\nOn  the question whether the tenant should have\\t been  givenrelief\\tagainst\\t forfeiture  the High Court  held  that\\t thematter\\twas one of discretion and both the lower courts\\t hadexercised  their discretion against the appellant  and\\tthatbeing so, unless they were satisfied that the discretion wasnot  judicially\\t exercised or was exercised  without  propermaterials  they\\t would not ordinarily interfere with  it  insecond\\tappeal.\\t  It was said that the non-payment  in\\tthiscase seems to have(1) (1932) 59 I.A. 236.', '5': 'A.I.R. 1935 Mad. 918.', '6': '(1914) 24 I.C. 139.', '7': \"(1918) I.L.R. 45 Cal. 469,1020landlord to determine a lease within the meaning of  section111  (g),  was\\tdissented from\\tin  Prakashchandra   Das  v.Rajendranath  Basu(1);\\tand  it was said that  there  is  nospecial\\t reason\\t why the lessor's election must be  made  atsome time prior to the institution of a suit and that it wasdifficult to find a raison d'etr for the view that the causeof action has not completely accrued if the election is madeat the moment when the suit is instituted, i.e., the  momentthe  plaint is presented.  The cause of action for the\\tsuitcan arise simultaneously with the presentation of a  plaint.In  our opinion the provision as to notice in writing  as  apreliminary to a suit for ejectment based on forfeiture of alease  is not based on any principle of justice,  equity  orgood  conscience and cannot govern leases made prior to\\t thecoming into force of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882,  orto leases executed prior to 1st April, 1930.  The rights andobligations  under  those  leases  have\\t to  be\\t  determinedaccording  to the rules of law prevailing -at the  time\\t andthe only rule applicable seems to be that a tenant cannot byhis unilateral act and by his own wrong determine the  leaseunless\\tthe lessor gives an indication by  some\\t unequivocalexpression  of intention on his part of taking advantage  ofthe breach.  On no principle of equity is a tenant  entitledto  a notice in writing telling him that the lease has\\tbeendetermined.  The High Court was therefore right in the\\tviewthat  it took of the matter and there are no  valid  reasonsfor taking a contrary view.\\nConsiderable  reliance\\twas placed by Mr.  Daphtary  on\\t thedecision  of Chandrasekhara Aiyar J. sitting singly  in\\t thecase  of  Umar\\tPulavar v.

In  pursuancethereof\\t a  request was made to the petitioners and  to\\t thesaid Prajapati Mishra to return the lands to Bettiah Estate.While  Sri Prajapati Mishra returned the land  settled\\twithhim, the petitioners refused to do so.\\nThe  Statement\\tof Objects and Reasons of  the\\tSathi  Lands(Restoration) Bill runs thus:\\n\"As  it has been held that the settlement of Sathi lands  inthe District of Champaran under the Court of Wards with\\t SriRam  Prasad Narayan Sahi and Shri Ram Rekha  Prasad  NarayanSahi is contrary to the provisions of the law and as Sri RamPrasad\\tNarayan\\t Sahi and Sri Ram Rekha\\t Narayan  Sahi\\thaverefused\\t  to  return  the  lands  to  the  Bettiah   Estate,Government1132have  decided to enact a law to restore these lands  to\\t theBettiah Estate.\"\\nThe\\timpugned  Act consists of three\\t sections.   Section2(1)  declares that \"notwithstanding anything  contained  inany  law  for  the time being  in  force\"\\',  the  settlementobtained by the appellants is \"null and void\", and that\\t \"noparty  to the settlement or his successor in interest  shallbe  deemed  to\\thave  acquired any  right  or  incurred\\t anyliability  thereunder\".\\t Sub-section (2) provides  that\\t theappellants  and\\t their successors in  interest\\t\"shall\\tquitpossession of the said land from the date of commencement ofthis  Act  and\\tif  they fail to do  so,  the  Collector  ofChamparan  shall  eject them and restore the  lands  to\\t thepossession  of\\tthe Bettiah Wards Estate\".   Subsection\\t (3)provides  for the refund of the amount of salami  money\\t andthe  cost  of  improvement, if any, to the  lessees  by\\t theestate on restoration to it of the lands in question. In the \"case\" lodged in this court for the State of  Bihar,the  legislation is sought to be justified and its  validitymaintained on the following grounds:\\n\" It is well settled that a Legislature with plenary  powersso long as it enacts law, within the ambit of its powers, iscompetent  to enact a law which may be applicable  generallyto  society  or to an individual or a class  of\\t individualsonly ... It is submitted that grants of the lands  belongingto  the\\t Bettiah Estate made by the Court of Wards  were  ofdoubtful  validity; hence they have been dealt with  by\\t theimpugned  Act  ...  No\\tevidence has  been  adduced  by\\t theappellants,  except  a bare allegation, which has  not\\tbeensubstantiated, that about 2000 acres of land were settled toshow that persons in similar circumstances with whom similarsettlements  were  made, were treated  differently.   It  issubmitted  that\\t in  the context the  impugned\\tAct,  has  areasonable basis of classification.\"\\nThe decision of the majority of this Court in Chiran v.\\t TheUnion\\tof  India(1)  is  relied  on  in  suport  of   thesecontentions, In that case, however, the (1) [1950] S.C.R. 869,1133majority felt justified in upholding the legislation, thoughit  adversely  affected\\t the  rights  and  interest  of\\t theshareholders  of a particular joint stock  company,  becausethe  mismanagement  of the company\\'s  affairs  prejudiciallyaffected the production of an essential commodity and causedserious\\t unemployment  amongst a section of  the  community.Mr.  Justice  Das  and I took  the  \\'view  that\\t legislationdirected  against a particular named person  or\\t corporationwas obviously discriminatory and could not  constitutionallybe  justified  even  if such legislation  resulted  in\\tsomebenefit\\t to  the  public.   In a  system  of  government  bypolitical parties, I was apprehensive of the danger inherentin special enactments which deprive particular named personsof their liberty or property because the Legislature  thinksthem  guilty  of  misconduct, and I said  in  my  dissentingopinion:\\n\"Legislation based upon mismanagement or other misconductas  the\\t differentia  and made\\tapplicable  to\\ta  specifiedindividual  or\\tcorporate body is not far removed  from\\t thenotorious  parliamentary  procedure  formerly  employed\\t  inBritain of punishing individual delinquents by passing billsof  attainder,\\tand  should not, I  think  receive  judicialencouragement.\"\\nMy  apprehensions have come true.  Recently we had  beforeus   a\\tcase  from  Hyderabad  (Civil  Appeal  ,No.  63\\t  of1952Ameerunnissa  Begum\\t v. Mahboob Begum)\\' where  the\\tdulyconstituted  legislative authority of that State  intervenedin a succession dispute between two sets of rival  claimantsto  the\\t estate of a deceased person and \" dismissed  \"\\t theclaim  of the one and adjudged the Property to the other  bymaking a special \" law \" to that effect.  And now comes thiscase  from  Bihar  of  an  essentially\\tsimilar\\t type.\\t Theappellants  assert title to certain lands in Bettiah  Estateunder  a  settlement  which  they  claim  to  have  lawfullyobtained from the Court of Wards, while it is now alleged onbehalf\\tof  the Estate that the settlement was not  for\\t thebenefit of the Estate and was contrary to law, as the  Courtof Wards did not then \" apply its(1)  Since reported as [1953] S.C.R 4041471134mind  \" to that question.  This is purely a dispute  betweenprivate\\t parties  and  a matter for  determination  by\\tdulyconstituted courts to which is entrusted, in every free\\t andcivilised society, the important function of adjudicating ondisputed legal rights, after observing the well\\t establishedprocedural  safeguards which include the right to be  heard,the  right to produce witnesses and so forth.  This  is\\t theprotection which the law guarantees equally to all  persons,and    our Constitution prohibits by article 14 every  Statefrom  denying  such protection to  anyone.   The  appellantsbefore\\tus  have been denied this protection.\\tA  politicalOrganization of the party in power decides after making suchenquiry\\t as it thought fit, that the settlement in  questionwas \" contrary to the provisions of law and public policy  \"and  the State Legislature, basing itself on such  decision,purports  to  declare the settlement \" null and void  \"\\t anddirects\\t the eviction of the appellants and the\\t restorationof  the\\t lands to the Estate.  The reasons  given  for\\tthisextraordinary  procedure  are indeed  remarkable  for  theirdisturbing  implications.   It\\tis  said  that\\t\"there\\t wasagitation amongst the tenants of the locality and oppositionon  the part of persons living in the locality\\tagainst\\t theappellants\\'  possession of the lands which led to breach  ofthe  peace  and institution of criminal cases  \".  Whenever,then,  a section of the people in a locality, in  \\'assertionof an adverse claim, disturb a person in the quiet enjoymentof  his property, the Bihar Government would seem  to  thinkthat  it  is  not necessary for the police  to\\tstep  in  toprotect\\t him  in his enjoyment until he is  evicted  in\\t duecourse of law, but the Legislature could intervene by makinga  \"  law  \"  to  oust\\tthe  person  from  his\\t possession.Legislation  such as we have now before us is calculated  todrain\\tthe  vitality  from  the  rule\\tof  law\\t which\\t ourConstitution  so  unmistakably proclaims, and it  is  to  behoped  that the democratic process in this country will\\t notfunction along these lines.\\nMUKHERJEA  J.-This  appeal, which has come before  us  on  acertificate granted by the High Court of1135Patna under article 132 (1) of the Constitution, is directedagainst a judgment of a Division Bench of that court,  dated3rd  January, 1952, by which the learned Judges dismissed  apetition  of  the  appellants  under  article  226  of\\t theConstitution.  The prayer in the petition was for a writ  inthe nature of mandamus, directing the opposite party, not totake   any  action,  under  an\\tAct  passed  by\\t the   BiharLegislative  Assembly in 1950 and known as The\\tSathi  Lands(Restoration)\\tAct  which  was\\t challenged  as\\t  void\\t andunconstitutional.\\nTo\\tappreciate  the points in  controversy\\tbetween\\t theparties\\t to the proceeding, it may be necessary\\t to  narratethe  material  facts  briefly.\\t Maharani  Janki  Koer,\\t therespondent No. 2 in the appeal, is the present\\tproprietressof an extensive Estate in Bihar known by the name of BettiahRaj, which is held and managed on her behalf by the Court ofWards,\\tBihar, constituted under Bengal Act IX of 1879.\\t  On19th  July, 1946, the appellants, who are two  brothers\\t andare distantly related to the Maharani, made a representationto  the\\t Government  of Bihar through  the  Manager  of\\t theEstate,\\t praying  for settlement in raiyati  right,  of\\t 200bighas\\tof  land preferably in Sathi farm  or  Materia\\tfarmalong with a certain quantity of waste lands.  On 20th July,1946, the then Manager of the Wards Estate wrote a letter tothe Collector of Champaran recommending that the  applicantsmight  be  given  settlement of the  lands  as\\tprayed\\tfor,without payment of any selami.\\tThe Collector, however,\\t didnot. agree to this proposal, nor did the Commissioner of theTirhut\\t Division,   and  the  matter  then  came   up\\t forconsideration before the Board of Revenue which\\t recommendedthat  settlement might be made with the applicants  providedthey  were agreeable to pay selami at half the usual  rates.On  14th  October, 1946, the recommendation of\\tthe  RevenueBoard was accepted by the Provincial Government and six dayslater  the  Court of Wards accepted a cheque for  Rs.  5,000from one of the lessees, towards payment of the selami moneyand  rent for the year 1354 F.S. On the 2nd November,  1946,possession1136of the lands was given to the appellants and on the 18th  ofNovember  following,  the  Manager of  the  Court  of  Wardsrecorded a formal order fixing the selami of the land at Rs.3,988 annas odd and rent at Rs. 797 annas odd per year.\\t  Onthe  same day, a Hisab Bandobasti form, which is  the  usualform  employed\\tin the Estate for raiyati  settlements,\\t wassigned by the Circle Officer on behalf of the Court of Wardsand  by\\t one  of  the lessees for himself  as  well  as\\t theconstituted  attorney  of  the other  lessees.\\t It  is\\t notdisputed  that\\tthe lessees continued to possess  the  landssince then on payment of the stipulated rent.   On  the  3rd June, 1950, the\\t Bihar\\tLegislative  Assemblypassed\\tan  Act known as The Sathi Lands  (Restoration)\\t Actwhich received the assent of the Governor on the 13th  June,1950.  The object of the Act, as stated in the preamble,  isto provide for restoration of certain lands belonging to theBettiah\\t Wards\\tEstate which were settled  contrary  to\\t theprovisions of law in favour of certain individuals.  Section2, which is the only material section in the Act, enacts  inthe  first  sub-section that the settlement of\\tSathi  lands(described  in\\tthe schedule to the Act) on  behalf  of\\t theBettiah\\t Court of Wards Estate with the appellants,  as\\t perorder of the Manager of the Estate dated the 18th  November,1946,  is  declared  null  and void  and  no  party  to\\t thesettlement ,or his successor-in-interest shall be deemed  tohave  acquired\\tany right or incur any liability  under\\t thesame.\\tThe second sub-section embodies a direction  to\\t theeffect that the said lessees and their successor-in-interestshall  quit  possession of the lands from the  date  of\\t thecommencement  of  the  Act and if they fail to\\tdo  so,\\t theCollector  of  Champaran shall eject them  and\\trestore\\t thelands  to the possession of the Bettiah Estate.\\t  The  thirdand  the last sub -section provides that the  Bettiah  WardsEstate\\tshall on restoration to it of the lands pay  to\\t thelessees\\t the selami money paid by them and also such  amountas  might have been spent by them in making improvements  onthe lands prior to the commencement of the Act.\\nIn substance, therefore, the Act declared the lease  grantedby  the Bettiah Wards Estate to the appellants on  the\\t18thNovember, 1946, to be illegal and inoperative and prescribedthe mode in which this declaration was to be given effect toand the lessees evicted from the lands.\\nOn the 28th August, 1950, the appellants filed the petition,out  of which this appeal arises, under article 226  of\\t theConstitution  in  the High Court of Patna,  challenging\\t thevalidity of The Sathi Lands Act and praying for a writ\\tuponthe respondents restraining them from taking any steps underthe said Act, or from interfering with the possession of theappellants  in respect of the lands comprised in the  lease.It  was\\t asserted  by the petitioners that  in\\tpassing\\t theimpugned legislation the Bihar Legislature actually  usurpedthe  power of the judiciary and the enactment was not a\\t lawat  all\\t in the proper sense of the expression.\\t  The  othermaterial  contentions raised were that the  legislation\\t wasvoid  as  it conflicted with the fundamental rights  of\\t thepetitioners  guaranteed under articles 14, 19(1) (f) and  31of the Constitution.\\nThe   respondents   opposite  parties\\tin   resisting\\t thepetitioners\\'  prayer  stated inter alia\\t in  their  counter-affidavit that the settlement of the lands in question\\twiththe  appellants\\t by  the Court of Wards,  was  not  for\\t thebenefit of the estate or advantage of the ward and that\\t thetransaction  was  entered into by the Wards  Estate  withoutproperly  applying their mind to it.  It was stated  furtherthat after the settlement was made, there was a good deal ofagitation among the tenants in the locality which led to theinstitution  of\\t certain  criminal  proceedings.   In  thesecircumstances,\\tthe matter was brought to the notice of\\t theWorking\\t Committee of the Indian National Congress  and\\t theWorking\\t Committee  was of opinion that\\t the  settlement  ofthese  lands  was  against public  interest.   The  lessees,therefore,  were  asked\\t to vacate the lands  and  on  theirrefusal the legislation in question was passed.The  petition  was heard by a Division Bench  consisting  ofRamaswami and Sarjoo Pershad JJ.  Ramaswami J.\\ndecided\\t all  the points raised by the\\tpetitioners  againstthem and held that the Act was neither ultra vires the BiharLegislature  nor  was  void  under  article  13(1)  of\\t theConstitution.  The learned Judge was further of opinion thatit  was\\t not a fit case for interference by the\\t High  Courtunder  article\\t226 of the Constitution. The  other  learnedJudge\\texpressed  considerable\\t doubts\\t as  to\\t whether   alegislation of this type, which in form and substance was  adecree\\tof a court of law, was within the competence of\\t thelegislature  and warranted by the Constitution.\\t He  agreed,however,  with his learned colleague that the case  was\\t notsuch  as  to justify an interference of the  High  Court  inexercise  of its discretionary powers under article  226  ofthe Constitution.  The remedy of the petitioners might\\tlie,according  to  him, in a regularly  constituted\\t suit.\\t Theresult,\\t therefore,  was that the appellants\\'  petition\\t wasdismissed and it is the propriety of this judgment that\\t hasbeen assailed before us in this appeal.'}", "subPara": "{'Mr': 'P. R. Das, who appeared in support of the appeal,\\t putforward\\t at the forefront of his arguments,  the  contentionraised\\ton behalf of his client in the court below that\\t theimpugned legislation was void by reason of its violating thefundamental rights of the appellants under article 14 of theConstitution.\\tThe point appeared to us to be of  substanceand after hearing the learned Attorney-General on this pointwe  were satisfied that the contention of Mr. Das was  well-founded\\t and entitled to prevail, irrespective of any  otherground that might be raised in this appeal.There  have been a number of decisions by this\\tcourt  wherethe question regarding the nature and scope of the guaranteeimplied\\t in the equal protection clause of the\\tConstitutioncame up for consideration and the general principles can  betaken to be fairly well settled. What this clause aims at isto  strike  down  hostile discrimination  or  oppression  orinequality.   As  the  guarantee  applies  to  all   personssimilarly situated, it is certainly open to the\\t legislatureto  classify  persons  and  things  to\\tachieve\\t  particularlegislative objects;\\nbut such selection or differentiation must not be  arbitraryand should rest upon a rational basis, having regard to\\t theobject\\twhich  the legislature has in view.   It  cannot  bedisputed  that\\tthe  legislation in  the  present  case\\t hassingled\\t out  two individuals and one  solitary\\t transactionentered into between them and another private party, namely,the Bettiah Wards Estate and has declared the transaction tobe  a  nullity\\ton the ground that it  is  contrary  to\\t theprovisions  of law, although there has been no\\tadjudicationon this point by any judicial tribunal.\\t It is not necessaryfor  our present purpose to embark upon a discussion  as  tohow  far  the  doctrine of \\'separation of  powers  has\\tbeenrecognised  in our Constitution and whether the\\t legislaturecan  arrogate  to  itself the powers of\\t the  judiciary\\t andproceed to decide disputes between private parties by makinga declaration of the rights of one against the other.  It isalso  unnecessary  to attempt to specify the  limits  withinwhich  any  legislation,  dealing  with\\t private-rights,  ispossible  within  the purview of our Constitution.   On\\t onepoint  our Constitution is clear and explicit, namely,\\tthatno law is valid which takes away or abridges the fundamentalrights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.  Therecan  be no question, therefore, that if the  legislation  inthe present case comes within the mischief of article 14  ofthe  Constitution, it has got to be declared invalid.\\tThisleads  us  to  the  question  as  to  whether  the  impugnedenactment is, in fact, discriminatory and if So, whether thediscrimination made by it can be justified on any  principleof reasonable classification ?\\nThe  appellants,  it is not disputed, are only\\ttwo  amongstnumerous leaseholders who hold lands in raiyati right  underthe  Bettiah Wards Estate.  It cannot also be disputed\\tthatthe  lands were settled with them on the  recommendation  ofthe  Board  of\\tRevenue\\t after\\tdue  consideration  of\\t therespective views put forward by the Manager of the Estate onthe   one  hand\\t and  the  Collector  and   the\\t  DivisionalCommissioner  on the other.  The appellants  are  admittedlypaying rents which are normally assessed on lands of similar1140description  in the locality.  The  learned  AttorneyGeneralreferred in this connection to the provisions of section  18of  the\\t Court\\tof Wards Act and argued that  the  lease  indispute\\t was  granted  in  contravention  of  that  section.Section 18 of the Court of Wards Act provides as follows:\"The Court may sanction the giving of leases or farms of anyproperty  under its charge ... and may direct the  doing  ofall  such  other  acts as it may judge to be  most  for\\t thebenefit of the property and the advantage of the Ward\".\\nApparently\\t it makes the Court of Wards the sole  judgeof the benefit to the estate or advantage of the ward.\\t Butit  is said that the Court of Wards did not apply  its\\tmindproperly  to  this  matter  when it  granted  lease  to\\t theappellants  at\\thalf the usual rate of\\tselami.\\t  The  WardsEstate thus suffered loss to the extent of nearly Rs.  4,000which could legitimately have been recovered from any  otherlessee.\\t  This\\tcontention  does not impress  us  much;\\t theutmost\\tthat  can be said is that this could have  been\\t putforward,  for what it is worth and with what result,  nobodycan say, as a ground for setting aside the lease in a  courtof law.\\t But that is not the question which is relevant\\t forour  present  purpose  at all; we were not  called  upon  todecide\\twhether\\t or  not  the lease  was  a  proper  one  orbeneficial to the estate.  The question for our decision is,whether\\t the statute contains discriminatory  provisions  sofar as the appellants are concerned and if so, whether thesediscriminations\\t could\\tbe  reasonably\\tjustified  ?  It  isclearly\\t stated in paragraph 9 of the affidavit made by\\t theappellants  in\\tsupport\\t of their petition  that  there\\t arenumerous other persons to whom leases on similar terms\\tweregranted\\t by the Bettiah Wards Estate.  Clauses (b), (c)\\t and', 'd': 'in\\t 1946,\\t1947,  1948  and  1949\\ta  good\\t number\\t  ofsettlements covering about 2000 acres of lands were  settledon  the basis of IO years\\' rental obtaining in the  localityand in some cases for good reasons, at five years\\' rental.\"In paragraph 12 of the counter-affidavit put in on behalf ofthe respondents, these statements are not denied.  In  fact,they  are  admitted and the only thing said is,\\t that  theseleases were granted in due course of management.   RamaswamiJ.  has dismissed this part of the case by simply  remarkingthat  no details of these settlements were furnished by\\t theappellants;  but no details were at all necessary  when\\t thecorrectness  of\\t the statements was not\\t challenged  by\\t therespondents.   It  will\\t be interesting\\t to  note  that\\t therespondents  themselves\\t in paragraph 10 of  their  counter-affidavit mentioned the name of Shri Prajapati Mishra as oneof  the\\t persons with whom similar settlement of  lands\\t wasmade by the Bettiah Estate.  It is stated in that  paragraphthat  the  cases of the appellants as well as  of  PrajapatiMishra\\twere brought to the notice of the Working  Committeeof  the Indian National Congress and the Committee  came  tothe  conclusion that both the settlements were\\tcontrary  tothe provisions of law.\\tThereupon a request was made to boththese sets of lessees to restore their lands to the  Estate,but  whereas  Prajapati\\t Mishra returned his  lands  to\\t theBettiah\\t Estate, the appellants refused to do so.  In  replyto this statement, the appellants stated in their  rejoinderthat the said Prajapati Mishra did not vacate the land,% butcreated\\t a  trust  in  respect of the  same,  he  being\\t thechairman  of the board Of trustees and the lands were  stillin  possession of the board of trustees.  Strangely,  as  itseems, the State of Bihar raked up this matter again in a1481142further\\t affidavit  where  it was  admitted  that  the\\tsaidPrajapati  Mishra did execute a trust and that the  trusteestook  possession of the property.  It was  stated,  however,that  Prajapati\\t Mishra, who was one of\\t the  trustees,\\t didactually  surrender  the lands in two installments  but\\t theother  trustees\\t did not, and hence legal advice  was  beingtaken to find out ways and means of recovering the  propertyfrom  them.  The whole thing smacks of disingenuousness\\t andthe State of Bihar, it seems, was not well advised in  rely-ing  upon  facts like these in their attempt  to  repel\\t theappellants\\'  attack  on\\t the legislation on  the  ground  ofdiscrimination.\\nBe that as it may, there is no doubt that the  appellantswere  not the only lessees under the Bettiah Estate who\\t gotsettlement  of lands at a selami of five years\\' rental.\\t  Onthe  sworn  statements\\tof the\\tappellants,  which  are\\t notchallenged  by\\tthe other side, it appears  that  there\\t arenumerous   persons  occupying  the  same  position  as\\t theappellants,   who   however   were   not   subjected\\t  tothis\\t      expropriatory  legislation.  But the  vice  inthis  legislation  goes much deeper than this.\\t It  is\\t notmerely\\ta  question of treating the  appellants\\t differentlyfrom  the  other lessees under the Wards Estate,  with\\twhomsettlements  of land have been made on similar or  identicalterms.\\tIf a lease has been given by a Court of Wards, whichis  not\\t for the benefit of the estate or advantage  of\\t theward,  it  is for a court of ,law to decide  whether  it  iswarranted  by the terms of the Court of Wards Act.   If\\t thelessor proceeds to cancel the lease, the lessee has a  legalright  to  defend his claim and satisfy the court  that\\t thelease  is  not in contravention of law.\\t If,  on  the  otherhand, the lessee is actually dispossessed, he has a right tosue  in court for recovery of possession of the property  onestablishing  that  he has been illegally turned  out.\\t Thedispute here, is a legal dispute pure and simple between twoprivate parties.  What the Legislature has done is to singleout  these  two individuals and deny them  the\\tright  whichevery  Indian  citizen possesses to have  his  rights  adju-dicated upon by a judicial tribunal in accordance with1143the law which applies to his case.  The meanest of  citizenshas  a right of access to a court of law for the redress  ofhis  just  grievances  and  it is of  this  right  that\\t theappellants have been deprived by this Act.  It is impossibleto  conceive of a worse form of discrimination than the\\t onewhich  differentiates a particular individual from  all\\t hisfellow\\tsubjects and visits him with a disability  which  isnot  imposed  upon anybody else and against which  even\\t theright  of  complaint is taken away.  The  learned  Attorney-General,  who  placed his case with his usual  fairness\\t andability,   could   not\\tput  forward   any   convincing\\t  orsatisfactory  reason  upon which this legislation  could  bejustified.  It is true that the presumption is in favour  ofthe constitutionality of a legislative enactment and it\\t hasto be presumed that a Legislature understands and  correctlyappreciates  the needs of its own people.  But when  on\\t theface of a statute there is no classification at all, and  noattempt has been made to select any individual or group withreference to any differentiating attribute peculiar to\\tthatindividual  or\\tgroup  and not\\tpossessed  by  others,\\tthispresumption is of little or no assistance. to the State.  Wemay  repeat with profit what was said by Mr. Justice  Brewerin  Gulf Colorado etc.\\tCo. v. Ellis(1) that \"to  carry\\t thepresumption to the extent of holding that there must be someundisclosed  and  unknown  reason  for\\tsubjecting  certain\"individuals  or corporations to hostile\\t and  discriminatorylegislation  is\\t to  make  the\\tprotection  clauses  of\\t theFourteenth Amendment a mere rope of sand\".

The two appellants are members of  the  UttarPradesh Civil Service.\\nIn March, 1950, appellant No. 1 (Rizwan-ul-Hasan) was postedas  District  Magistrate,  Jalaun,  and\\t appellant  No.\\t  2,Mohammad  Munawar,  was posted as a Magistrate in  the\\tsamedistrict, having officiated as District Magistrate for\\tsometime in the early part of March, 1960.\\nOn 2nd March, 1,950, one Phundi Singh commenced\\t proceedingsunder  section 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in\\t theCourt  of  the Sub-Divisional Magistrate of  Jalaun  on\\t theallegation that Kedarnath and Matadin were about to cut\\t hisstanding  crop\\tby  force and \\'that there  was\\tan  imminentdanger\\tof  a breach of the peace.   The  magistrate  issuednotices\\t to  the  parties  complained  against\\tand  orderedattachment of the standing crop.\\nOn 4th March, 1950, one Shriram, brother of Kedarnath, fileda  counter  application\\t before\\t the  court  making  certainallegations against one Thakur Pratap Singh, said to be\\t thereal  person  behind  the proceedings  commenced  by  PhundiSingh.\\t Kedarnath  and Matadin, the respondents  in  PhundiSingh\\'s\\t application, also filed an application\\t similar  tothat  of Shriram before the District Magistrate on the\\tsamedate.  This application was accompanied by a  recommendatoryletter\\twritten\\t to  the District Magistrate  by  Lalla\\t RamDwivedi,  Secretary,  District Congress Committee.   It\\t wasreceived by the second appellant who was then officiating asDistrict  Magistrate  and  was\\tsent  by  him  to  the\\tSub-Divisional Magistrate, Jalaun, in whose court Phundi Singh\\'sapplication  was  pending, for report.\\t The  Sub-DivisionalMagistrate  returned it with the remark that a\\tproper\\tcom-plaint\\tshould be made in his court in the ordinary  way  onthe  allegations  made in the  application.   Thereupon\\t thesecond\\tappellant returned the application to Kedarnath\\t andMatadin\\t  and  advised\\tthem  to  move\\tthe   Sub-DivisionalMagistrate in as formal and proper manner.On  the\\t application of Phundi Singh made  before  the\\tHighCourt of Allahabad under section 3 of the584Contempt of Courts Act, the second appellant was held guiltyof   contempt  of  the\\tSub-Divisional\\tMagistrate  on\\t thefollowing reasoningShri  Mohammad\\tMunawar\\t opposite  party  No.  5   forwardedapplication  given  by\\tthe opposite parties Nos\\'  2  and  3together  with\\tintroductory letter  to\\t the  Sub-DivisionalMagistrate,Jalaun.

But  intention  is   not\\t \\'ofimportance so far as the question of commission of  contemptis concerned.

He says in\\t hisaffidavit and we can accept it that he sent this applicationto the Sub-Divisional Magistrate just for taking action\\t forthe protection of opposite parties No. 2 and No. 3 and theircrop about which an allegation was made that some action wasto  be\\ttaken by the other party the  night  following.\\t  Heshould\\tin  the circumstances either pass an order  for\\t thepolice\\thimself\\t which he could have very well done,  or  hecould\\thave   just  conveyed  a  gist\\tof   the   complaintnecessitating  protection of life and property\\timmediately.His  conduct  in transmitting the allegations  made  by\\t theopposite  parties  No.\\t2  and\\t3  to  the  Sub\\t  DivisionalMagistrate,  Jalaun, in whose court the case  under  section145, Criminal Procedure Code, was pending, did amount to thecommission of contempt of that court.\" -\\nAs  regards the first appellant, the facts are that on\\t22ndMarch  an application was received by post in the office  ofthe   District\\tMagistrate  signed  by\\tShriram\\t  containingallegations  against the trying Magistrate.  On 25th  March,1950, this application was sent by the appellant for  reportto   the  Sub-Divisional  Magistrate  with   the   followingendorsement585S.   D.C. Please look into these allegations and let me havea report.\" On 4th April, 1950, the Sub Divisional Magistratesubmitted  a  report  and the first  appellant\\thaving\\tbeensatisfied  that\\t the allegations were  baseless\\t passed\\t thefollowing order:-\\n\"  I  do not see any reason to withdraw the case  from\\tyourfile.\"\\nOn  the\\t application of Phundi Singh  mentioned\\t above\\tmadebefore\\tthe High Court of Allahabad under section 3  of\\t theContempt of Courts Act this appellant along with others\\t wasalso   held  guilty  of\\t contempt  of\\tthe   Sub-DivisionalMagistrate\\'s Court, on the following reasoning :-\"Similarly  transmission of the application sent by  Shriramon the 25th March to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate,  Jalaun,amounted  to  commission of contempt of\\t court\\tby  oppositeparty  No.  6. The mere fact that he had to take  action  inview  of  the  allegations against the\\tmagistrate  in\\tthatapplication would not affect this question.  The applicationcontained,  as\\talready\\t stated,  expressions  showing\\tthatPhundi\\tSingh was a history sheeter and that the case  undersection 145, Criminal Procedure Code, was fictitious and wasinstituted  at the instance of Pratap Singh.  He should\\t nothave  transmitted  the entire application.   He\\t could\\thavenecessary extracts which related to the allegations  againstthe   magistrate  sent\\tto  the\\'  court\\t concerned  in\\t thecircumstances\\twhen   the  applicants\\t introduced   matterirrelevant  for\\t transfer  application.\\t  It  may  also\\t  bementioned  here that the application could be treated  as  atransfer application though no such request was made in thatapplication.  The application was neither properly presentednor  was it accompanied by an affidavit nor was it  stamped.The  applicant wanted some action for the protection of\\t hiscrop from bad characters.\"\\nHaving found both the appellants guilty of contempt of courtof  the\\t Sub-Divisional Magistrate, Jalaun, the\\t High  Courttook no action against them because they happened to  commitcontempt of court rather due to their carelessness Find lackof vigilance586than  with  any deliberate intention to commit it.   It\\t wasobserved  that officers who have to transmit  communicationsto  courts of justice should be vigilant and careful to\\t seethat nothing is transmitted which can have any effect,\\tevenremotely on, the merits of a case.\\nIn  our\\t judgment,  the proceedings for\\t contempt  of  courtagainst\\t  the  two  appellants\\ton  the\\t facts\\tstated\\t aremisconceived  and have to be quashed.  Both  the  appellantswere  superior officers of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate  atthe  time when they sent the applications of  Kedarnath\\t andMatadin for report.  They were under a duty to supervise hiswork.\\tIt  is\\tdifficult to see  how  by  transmitting\\t theapplications received by them to him, and asking him for hisviews  they were in any way interfering with the  course  ofjustice\\t and were committing contempt of his  court.   Theiraction\\tcannot\\tbe  characterized as having  a\\ttendency  tointerfere with the course of justice.  The applications weretransmitted  to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate in  the  usualand  normal course of the official practice and\\t we  \\'cannotsubscribe  to the view of the High Court that only  extractsof  these applications should have been sent to him for\\t hisviews  and  not the applications as such as  they  containedmaterial  which had a tendency to interfere with the  courseof justice.\\nThe  second appellant, when he was officiating\\tas  DistrictMagistrate,  received  the  application\\t of  Kedarnath\\t andMatadin\\t with a letter of recommendation from the  Secretaryof  the\\t Congress Committee.  This application\\twas  in\\t thenature\\tof  a  counter complaint, and  the  appellant  actedproperly  in sending it to the magistrate who was seised  ofthe original application.  He was under no duty to censor itand  to\\t out it into pieces and then  forward  the  relevantparts only to the magistrate.  The recommendatory letter wasan  annexure  to the application and it had to go  with\\t it.The  conduct of the Secretary of the Congress  Committee  inwriting a recommendatory letter about the facts of the\\tcaseto the District587Magistrate  was undoubtedly a communication for the  purposeof  influencing his decision and was rightly  reprobated  bythe High Court.\\t Such 9, course is calculated, if tolerated,to  divert the course of justice and ought  more  frequentlythan  it is, to be treated as what it really is\\'  namely,  ahigh  contempt\\tof court.  The Congress Secretary  has\\tbeenrightly\\t held guilty of contempt and punished.\\tHe  has\\t notcome to this Court and we are no longer concerned with\\thim.But  we are unable to find how the conduct of the  appellantin sending the application which, as we have already stated,was  in the nature of counter charge to\\t the  Sub-DivisionalMagistrate  who was seised of the original complaint in\\t anyway  amounted  to  contempt  of\\t court.\\t  There\\t are   threedifferent  sorts of contempts known to law in such  matters.One  kind  of  contempt is scandalizing\\t the  court  itself.There  may  likewise be a contempt of the court\\t in  abusingparties\\t who are concerned in causes in that  court.   Theremay  also  be  a contempt of court  in\\tprejudicing  mankindagainst\\t persons before the cause is heard.  The act of\\t theappellant   could  not\\tfall  in  either  of   these   threecategories.\\nSo  far\\t as  the first appellant  is  concerned,  under\\t theprovisions of section 528 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,he  had authority to withdraw the case under section 145  ofthe  Code  pending  in\\tthe  court  of\\tthe   Sub-DivisionalMagistrate.   On  the  application of  22nd  March  made  byKedarnath  and\\tMatadin containing allegations\\tagainst\\t theSub-Divisional Magistrate he was entitled to use his  powersunder that section if the allegations contained therein weresubstantiated.\\tIt is usual to send such applications to thecourt  concerned for its remarks and that is precisely\\twhathe did. and as soon as the remarks were received and he\\t wassatisfied that the allegations were baseless, he declined towithdraw the case.  We have not been able to see how such anaction\\ton the part of the District Magistrate, done in\\t thenormal\\tand usual course of the discharge of his  duties  assuch magistrate, could be held to interfere with the 76588course of administration of justice or to create pre-\\t re-judice\\t of  any  kind\\tagainst\\t the  complainant   in\\t theproceedings  under  section  145 of  the  Code\\tof  CriminalProcedure.  There is nothing in section 528 of the  CriminalProcedure  Code\\t which\\tdisables a  magistrate\\tfrom  taking\\n-action unless he is set in motion by the petition of one ofthe parties and nothing in the Code prevents any person frombringing  facts\\t to the notice of  the\\tDistrict  Magistratewhich might suggest to that magistrate that it was advisableto  see whether the magistrate should remain in charge of  aparticular case.\\nIn  our judgment, therefore, the High Court was in error  inthinking   that\\t the  two  appellants  acted   without\\t duecircumspection\\tand thought and were guilty of\\tcontempt  ofthe court of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate.  We are  furtherof  the\\t opinion that it was not possible to hold  on  thosefacts  that  any prejudice &rose in the case  by  these\\t twoapplications  being  sent  by the  appellants  to  the\\tSub-Divisional  Magistrate or that any action was necessary\\t forthe protection of the tribunal which was engaged in  hearingthe  case  under section 145, Criminal Procedure  Code.\\t  Asobserved by Rankin C.J. in Anantalal Singha v. Alfred  HenryWatson\\t(1),  the  jurisdiction in contempt  is\\t not  to  beinvoked unless there is real prejudice which can be regardedas  a,\\tsubstantial  interference with\\tthe  due  course  ofjustice\\t and  that the purpose of the court\\'s  action  is  apractical  purpose  and\\t it  is\\t reasonably  clear  on\\t theauthorities  that  the court will not  exercise\\t its  juris-diction upon a mere question of propriety.The  result  is\\t that we allow the  appeal,  set  aside\\t thejudgment  of the High Court against the two  appellants\\t andacquit them of the charge under section 3 of the Contempt ofCourts Act.\\nAppeal allowed.\\nAgent for the appellant-: S.

The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyMAHAJAN\\t J.-One Thangathammal who was a dasi (dancing  girl)lived  in  the\\tTanjore district in Madras  State  and\\tdiedpossessed of some properties.  She left her surviving  threedaughters, Saraswathi, Jagadambal and Meenambal.  Jagadambalfiled the suit out of which941this appeal arises against her sisters for partition of\\t themovable\\t and immovable properties set out in the plaint\\t andfor allotment of a third share to her therein.\\tShe  allegedthat  her mother was married to one Thyagaraja Pillai,\\tthatthe properties in suit were the stridhanam properties of hermother\\twho  died  intestate on 26th July,  1943,  and\\tthataccording to the law or custom of the community to which theparties belonged she and her sisters were entitled to  shareequally the properties of her mother.\\nSaraswathi Ammal, the 1st defendant contested the suit.\\t Shepleaded\\t that her mother was not a married woman but a\\tdasiwho  followed her hereditary occupation and was attached  toShri  Saranatha Perumal temple at Tiruchurai in the  Tanjoredistrict, that of the three daughters the plaintiff and\\t the2nd  defendant married and lived with their husbands,  whileshe (1st defendant) was duly initiated as a dasi in the saidtemple and remained unmarried and that according to the\\t lawand custom of the community, the mother\\'s property  devolvedsolely on her to the exclusion of the plaintiff and the\\t 2nddefendant.  The 2nd defendant supported the 1st\\t defendant\\'scase.  The material issue in the suit was issue No. 1  whichwas in these terms:-\\n\"  Who\\tis  the\\t proper\\t heir  of  Thangathammal.    Whetheraccording  to  custom as set tip by the plaintiff,  all\\t thedaughters are heirs, or according to the custom put  forwardby  the\\t 1st defendant, -the unmarried daughters  alone\\t areentitled to inherit.\"\\nThe  Subordinate  Judge\\t dismissed  the\\t suit  holding\\tthatThangathammal  was  a  dasi and not a  married\\twoman,\\tthataccording  to  the  custom of the dasi\\tcommunity  in  SouthIndia,\\ta dasi daughter is regarded as a nearer heir to\\t themother\\tthan a married daughter and that the  1st  defendantwas entitled to remain in possession of the suit properties.Against this decision an appeal was taken to the High Court.The High Court reversed the decree of the Subordinate  Judgeand held that the custom pleaded by the 1st defendant942was not proved and that the rule of propinquity of Hindu lawas  a rule of justice, equity and good conscience,  governedthe  succession\\t and  the married and  dasi  daughters\\twereequally\\t entitled to the inheritance.  It was  further\\theldthat  a dasi daughter was not in the status of a  maiden  orunmarried daughter for purposes of succession to  stridhanamproperty.  Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was  grantedunder article 133 of the Constitution.\\nAfter bearing the learned counsel for the appellant, we feelno  hesitation in concurring with the decision of  the\\tHighCourt.\\tIt was contended that the High Court was in error inholding\\t that  the custom set up by the\\t defendant  was\\t notproved.\\t  To  prove the custom that a dasi  daughter  was  apreferential heir and excluded her married sisters  reliancewas placed on, the evidence of some members of the communityand reference was also made to certain instancese same\\tkindof  evidence was led by the plaintiff support of  her  case.The evidence of both the parties on the the issue of  customis of an unsatisfactory and inconclusive character and\\tfromit no inference can be drawn of the existence of a  uniform,certain\\t and ancient custom prevailing in the  community  onthis point.\\nOut  of\\t the  defendant\\'s  witnesses,  the  first   witness,Rajagopal Pillai, deposed that his wife was the daughter  ofdasi  Kamakshi\\twho  had six daughters of  whom\\t three\\tweremarried and three were dasis, that on Kamakshi\\'s death,\\t herdasi daughters alone would take the inheritance and that hiswife,  would be excluded.  This statement does not hurt\\t himin  any way as his wife will not be bound by what  be  mightstate.\\tHis bald assertion about the custom in the communityis  not of much value.\\tHe does not disclose any  source  ofhis  information.  In cross-examination he admitted that  hedid not know a single specific instance where such a  customwas enforced . The second witness on the point is the  firstdefendant.  She stated that one Tulasi\\'s sister Mangalam gotno  share  in  her mother Ammani\\'s  properties.\\t  In  cross-examination  it was admitted that Mangalam died\\t about\\tfortyears ago,943i.e.,  some time before the defendant was born.\\t  She  couldtherefore   have  no  personal\\tknowledge   about   Ammani\\'sinstance.    No\\t written  record  of  that  inheritance\\t  isforthcoming.  Mangalams son Govindaswami Pillai appeared  asD.  W.\\t3.  He deposed that  Mangalam\\'s\\t mother\\t Ammani\\t haddivided\\t her  properties between her dasi daughters  in\\t herlifetime.   The\\t instance  therefore  is  not  an   instanceconcerning  succession and cannot be treated as relevant  inthis  enquiry.\\t The  1st defendant further  deposed  to  aninstance  in  Srirangam when succession opened\\tout  on\\t thedeath of dasi Chellappa.  It was said that her property\\t wastaken  by her dasi daughter Visalakshi to the  exclusion  ofher  married daughters Marakatham and Rukmini and  that\\t theassets were worth a lakh of rupees.  One would have expectedsome written documents about that sucession if it took placein  the manner deposed to.  In the absence of  any  evidencefrom the descendants of Chellappa and in the absence of\\t anydocumentary   evidence\\tregarding  that\\t succession  it\\t  isdifficult to place any reliance on this so-called  instance.Defendant  No.\\tI stated that her knowledge of it  was\\tonlyfrom  hearsay,\\tand the requirements of section\\t 32  of\\t theEvidence Act not being fulfilled, her evidence on this pointcannot\\tbe treated as admissible.  The third witness,  aboutwhom reference has already been made, apart from deposing asto  Mangalam\\'s instance also deposed about the\\tinstance  ofdasi Meenakshi.\\t Her daughter Jeevaratnam is married to\\t thewitness.  He said that Meenakshi\\'s dasi daughters  inheritedher  property  and  that his wife was  excluded.   The\\tonlyproperty  alleged  to belong to Meenakshi was a\\t house,\\t thevalue of which is not known.  The succession is said to haveoccurred  over twenty years ago.  None of the  daughters  ofMeenakshi  have been examined as witnesses in the  case,  toenable the court to find out the details about it and merelyon the statement of this witness the instance cannot be heldproved.\\t  The fourth witness for the defendant is  her\\tnon-contesting sister.  She said nothing on the on the  questionof custom.  She, however, stated944that  she was not entitled to a share in the assets  of\\t hermother.\\t  When asked why she was making that statement,\\t shesaid  that she was saying so because her husband  and  some.elders\\t(whose names were. not disclosed) had told  her\\t so.Evidence of this character on the question of custom  cannotbe   seriously\\t considered.   Venugopal   Pillai   is\\t thefifth,witness  for the defendant.  He is the husband of\\t thesecond\\tdefendant.  His evidence regarding the\\tinstance  ofChellappa is purely, hearsay.  He deposed that he had learntthat  a dasi\\'s married daughter is not entitled to  claim  ashare  as  she\\tis not her heir in the presence\\t of  a\\tdasidaughter and therfore he told his wife not to claim a share.He  did not disclose the source of his information.   JanakiAmmal,\\tthe sixth witness, is a dasi.  She deposed that\\t shehas  five daughters of whom two are married, one is  a\\tdasiand  the  other two are young girls and\\t that  according  totheir caste custom her properties on her death would devolveon  her dasi daughters and that the married  daughters\\tmustremain\\tcontent with the presents given at  their  marriage.In  cross-examination  she admitted that  she  was  deposingabout  the  caste custom not from any specific\\tinstance  inwhich  the  custom was observed but at the  request  of\\t thedefendant,  and that she bad heard of this custom  from\\t herelders\\twhose  names  she did  not  disclose.\\tShe  furtheradmitted  that she had an uncle living but she did not\\tevenask  him about the custom.  The witness, it  appears,  knowsnothing about the custom and is giving evidence in order  tooblige\\tthe defendant.\\tThe next witness \\'Who gave  evidenceon the issue is D. W. 8, Kamalathammal, a dasi.\\t Her  motherwas  also a dasi.  She deposed that her mother\\'s  propertieswere divided between her and her other dasi sister and Amba,her  third sister, who was married, was not given  a  share.In cross-examination she admitted that Amba never asked\\t fora share.  Neither was Amba produced, nor any written munici-pal records showing that the witness actually inherited\\t theproperty  of  her mother to the exclusion of  Amba.   It  isdifficult to hold this incident proved merely on the945vague  testimony of this witness.  Pappathi Ammal, the\\tnextwitness\\t in the case, is also a dasi.  She deposed that\\t herfather\\'s   mother\\'s  property  devolved\\t on  her  two\\tdasidaughters  on  her  death  and that  there  was\\t no  marrieddaughter  in  existence.   This- evidence is  of  a  neutralcharacter  and is not of much use on the question of  custompleaded\\t in  the case.\\tApart from asserting  that  in\\tthiscommunity dasi\\'s property devolves on her death only on\\t thedasi  daughters to the exclusion of married  daughters,\\t shecited  the instance of Chellappa, a dasi of  Srirangam.\\t  Itwas  elicited  in cross examination that  Chellappa  left  ahouse and landed properties.  No explanation is\\t forthcomingwhy  documentary  evidence  of revenue\\trecords\\t about\\tthisinstance has been withheld.  Oral evidences as to  instanceswhich can be proved by documentary evidence cannot safely berelied\\tupon  to  establish  custom,  when  no\\tsatisfactoryexplanation  for  withholding the best kind of\\tevidence  isgiven.\\t The  last witness in the case\\tis  Rajamani  Ammal,another dasi who does service in Sri Ranganathaswami temple.She  also referred to the instance of Chellappa.   She\\tsaidthat her jewels which were worth Rs. 1,000 would pass on herdeath  to  her\\tdasi daughter.\\tShe went to  the  length  ofsaying that if a dasi leaves an only child who is a  marriedwoman,\\teven  then her properties will pass to a  next\\theirsuch  as a cousin and not a married daughter.  This  is\\t allthe evidence led by the defendant to prove custom.  On\\tthismeagre\\tand unsatisfactory material we cannot hold that\\t thecustom pleaded is proved.  The opinion evidence is not of  aconvincing  character and evidence as to specific  instancesin support of the custom is really nil.\\nOur  attention\\twas also drawn to a decision of\\t the  MadrasHigh  Court in Shanmugathammal v. Gomathi Ammal(l)  In\\tthatcase the plaintiff, a member of the dasi community,  claimedto  succeed to her deceased maternal aunt and  pleaded\\tthatthe  three  surviving  sisters\\tof  the\\t deceased  who\\twereimpleded as defendants were not entitled to inherit  becauseone of them(1)  67 M.L.J. 861.\\nhad  been adopted by another dancing girl and the other\\t twohad  become  married.\\tThe issue raised  in  the  case\\t waswhether\\t the  custom  set up by\\t the  plaintiff\\t that  amongdancing\\t women\\tmarried women are excluded by  a  woman\\t whocontinues  to  be\\' a dasi is true,  valid  and\\tenforceable.Certain\\t dasis gave evidence in support of the\\tcustom.\\t  Noevidence  whatever was given to the contrary and the  custompleaded\\t was held proved in the circumstances of that  case.Emphasis was laid on the circumstance that there was no evi-dence whatsoever against the plaintiff and defendants 2\\t and3  who denied the existence of the custom in  their  writtenstatements did not venture to deny it on oath in the witnessbox.  The dasi community concerned in that case was a  smallone  consisting\\t originally of twenty houses of\\t which\\tonlyseven or eight were then in existence and in that  situationit was said that the custom might well be one that was\\twellrecognized  and so much a part of the consciousness  of\\t thecommunity, that any dispute like the present dispute amongstso  small  a  body  of women  would  be\\t an  extremely\\trareoccurrence  and therefore impossible of proof and  that\\t theplaintiff  could  not reasonably be expected to\\t search\\t thepresidency for witnesses to speak to some similar dispute inother  places.\\t In  our opinion,  that\\t decision  does\\t notfurnish\\t a good judicial instance in respect of\\t the  custompleaded in the present case.  There is no evidence that\\t thecustoms\\t of that small community of dasis are applicable  tothe  community\\tof dasis in the present case  which  form  aconsiderable community in this district.  Moreover, the casewas  decided on the peculiar circumstances of that  case  onvery  meagre  materials\\t and did not lay  down\\tany  generalcustom of dasis on this point.\\nIt  is\\tunnecessary to examine the plaintiff\\'s\\tevidence  indetail.\\t  Suffice it to say that it is more than  sufficientto   rebut  the\\t evidence  led\\tby  the\\t defendant  and\\t  itneutralizes its effect, if any.\\t In the absence of proof  ofexistence  of a custom governing succession the decision  ofthe  case  has to rest on the rules of justice,\\t equity\\t andgood conscience because admittedly no947clear  text of Hindu law applies to such a case.   The\\tHighCourt  thought\\tthat  the  just rule to\\t apply\\twas  one  ofpropinquity to the case, according to which the married\\t anddasi  daughters\\t would take the mother\\'s property  in  equalshares.\\t No exception can be taken to this finding given  bythe  High Court.  No other rule was suggested to us  leadingto a contrary result.\\nIt was argued that the dasis have a distinct status in Hindusociety\\t and,  that  a rule has\\t been  evolved\\tby  judicialdecisions  under  which the state of degradation  by  itselffurnishes  a  rule of preference in a  competition  -betweendasi   daughters  and  married\\tdaughters.   The   juidicialdecisions  referred to concern the community of\\t prostitutesand  the rule evolved concerning them has been abrogated  bylater decisions.  It was contended that though the said rulehad  been  abrogated and was no, longer applicable  to\\tthatcommunity  concerning  which it was evolved,  it  should  byanalogy\\t be  applied  to  cases\\t of  succession\\t to   dasis.Narasanna  v. Oangu(1) was the first case cited.  There,  anadopted niece of a prostitute dancing girl was preferred  toa  brother remaining in caste.\\tIt was said that  the  legalrelation   between  a  prostitute  dancing  girl   and\\t herundegraded relations remaining in caste becomes severed\\t andthey  are therefore not entitled to inherit the estate.\\t  InSubbaratna  Mudali v. Balakrishnaswami Naidu(2),  the  next,case  cited,  the facts were that a  deceased  woman  Palaniinherited the property in dispute from her mother Nagu,\\t whoinherited  it from her mother Mottai who again inherited  itfrom  her father Arunachalam.  Arunachalam had two  brothersRamaswami and Mathurbutham and the question in that case waswhether\\t Mathurbutham\\'s\\t daughter  Seethai  or\\t Ramaswami\\'sdaughter\\'s  son Marudamuthu Mudali was the heir\\t of  Palani.The  learned  judges held that Mathurbutham\\'s  daughter\\t waspreferential  heir  to Ramaswami\\'s daughter\\'s son.   It\\t waspointed out that the rule of preference based on degradationwas no longer good law.\\t It was, however,(1) I.L.R. 13 Mad. 133.', '2': '71 M.L.J. 785.\\nPrivy Council in Abdul Hussein Khan v. Soma Dero(1).  It wasthere  said  that it is incumbent on a party  setting  up  acustom to allege and prove the custom on which he relies andit  is\\tnot any theory of custom or  deductions\\t from  othercustoms\\t which can be made a rule of decision but  only\\t anycustom\\tapplicable to the parties concerned that can be\\t therule  of decision in a particular case.\\t It is well  settledthat  custom  cannot  be extended by analogy.\\tIt  must  beestabished  inductively,  not deductively and it  cannot  beestablished  by\\t a priori methods.  Theory  and\\t custom\\t areantitheses,  custom  cannot be a matter of mere\\t theory\\t butmust  always  be a matter of fact and one custom  cannot  bededuced from another.  A community living in one  particulardistrict may have evolved a particular custom but from\\tthatit  does  not follow that the community\\t living\\t in  anotherdistrict is necessarily following the same-custom.The  last point taken by the learned counsel was that  underHindu  law  the 1st defendant as a maiden  was\\tentitled  topreference  over her married sisters.  Defendant No.  I\\t wasadmittedly  married to the idol and she has been on her\\t ownshow.  living  a  life of prostitution.\\t  The  text  of\\t theMitakshara  dealing  with the case of a virgin can.  not  beapplied\\t to  her  case. [Vide Tara v.  Krishna(1)].   It  isinconceivable that when the sages laid down the principle ofpreference  concerning unmarried daughters they\\t would\\thaveintended  to include a prostitute within the ambit  of\\tthattext.\\nFor  the reasons given above we see no force in this  appealand it is dismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed,Agent for appellant: S.

Moti Sagar(1) Shri N. C.

The  earliestdocument  referred  to is Exhibit P/11, being  a  conveyanceexecuted  in 1226 B.S.1819-1820 by Sheikh Manik and  anotherin favour of Mrs. Cynthia Mills Junior.\\t How the vendors hadacquired their title is not known.

The consideration\\t forthe sale(1) (1927) L. R. 54 1. A. 178.\\nwas  Rs. 1,000.\\t The following provisions of the  sale\\tdeedare of importance:--\\n\"From this date being entitled to make gift and sale of\\t thesaid  property,\\t you do bring into your own  possession\\t thesaid  lands  etc.,  and on paying  annually  to\\t the  MaliksZemindars  Rs. 480 (Rupees-four and annas eight)  in  Siccascoins  as rent and on getting your name mutated in place  ofmine  and obtaining Dakhilas in your own name, you do go  onpossessing and enjoying the same with great felicity down toyour sons and grandsons etc., in succession.\"By  a conveyance Exhibit P/9, dated the 10th October,  1856,Mrs.  Sabina  Love transferred the premises to\\tone  FrancisHoratio\\t Dobson.   The\\tpremises  were\\tthere  described  as\"garden\\t land  held under Mourashi Patta\"  which  Patta\\t hassince  been held to be a spurious document in  a  subsequentlitigation.  It appears from this document that Mrs. CynthiaMills had excavated a tank and constructed a pucca ghat\\t andlaid  out  a garden and that on her death her son  and\\theirJohn  Henry Mills came into possession of the land and\\tthathe had sold the premises to Mrs. Sabina Love and that  afterher  purchase Mrs. Sabina Love had enclosed the\\t said  landsand  had manufactured bricks with the earth of the land\\t shepurchased.

Nanda Lal Dule ( 4 ) that\\t thetenancy in this case cannot be regarded as a permanent\\tone.The decisions in those cases have to be read in the light ofthe facts of those particular cases.  The mere fact of\\trenthaving been received from a certain person may not, as\\theldin Rasamoy Purkatt v. Srinath Moyra (supra) and Digbijoy Royv.  Shaikh  Aya Rahman (supra), amount to a  recognition  ofthat person as a tenant.  Mere possession for generations ata  uniform  rent or construction of permanent  structure  byitself\\tmay not be conclusive proof of a permanent right  asheld  in Kamal Kumar Dutt v. Nanda Lal Dule (supra) but\\t thecumulative  effect of such fact coupled with  several  otherfacts  may lead to the inference of a permanent\\t tenancy  asindicated even in the case of Satyendra Nath v.

It is not known  how\\t theearliest  known tenant Shaik Manik acquired the\\t tenancy  orwhat the nature of that tenancy was.  The tenancy has passedfrom  one person to another by inheritance or by will or  bytransfers  inter  vivos.   In  the  deeds  of  transfer\\t thetransferee  has been given the right to enjoy  the  propertyfrom  generation  to generation for ever.  A tank  has\\tbeenexcavated  and a pucca ghat built on the land.\\tBricks\\thavebeen manufactured with the earth taken from the land and thepremises  have\\tbeen  enclosed within  pucca  walls.   Puccabuildings have been erected and mortgages have been executedfor substantial amounts.  Although there was an\\t enhancementof  rent  in 1860 that rent has continued to  be  paid\\teversince  then.   Portion\\tof  the\\t premises,  namely,  No.  2,Watkin's Lane, has been used as a factory by the  plaintiffsand  on\\t the other portion, namely, No.\\t 3,  Watkin's  Lane,residential buildings were -erected which indicate that\\t thelease was for residential purposes.

In spite of the\\tincrease  inland value and the letting value the landlords through\\twhomthe plaintiff derives his title did not at any time make mayattempt\\t  to  eject  the  tenant  or  to  get  any   furtherenhancement of rent since 1860.\\t All these circumstances puttogether are explicable only on the hypothesis of permanencyof the tenure and they irresistibly lead to the\\t conclusion,as  held by the lower Courts, that the tenancy\\tin  questionwas  heritable\\tand  a\\tpermanent  one.\\t  The  decision\\t  ofMukherjea,  J.,\\t in the case of Probhas Chandra\\t Mallick  v.Debendra  Nath Das (supra) is definitely in point.

Appeals  to\\t theAppellate   Assistant  Commissioner  \\'and   the\\t  Income-taxAppellate Tribunal having failed, the appellants applied  tothe Tribunal for reference of the question of law arising inthe case to the High Court at Madras for its  determination,and   the  Tribunal  accordingly  referred   the   followingquestion:\\n\"Whether in the circumstances of this case, the  moneysdeposited  by customers with the assessee firm\\tas  securitydeposits were \"borrowed money\" within the meaning of Rule 2-A  of  the Second Schedule to the Excess  Profits  Tax\\tAct,1940,  either  throughout the chargeable  accounting  periodended  12th  April,  1945,  or\\tduring\\tany  part  of\\tthatchargeable accounting period ? \"\\nThe  reference  was heard by a Division  Bench  of\\t theCourt (Satyanarayana Rao and Viswanatha Sastri JJ.) and\\t thelearned\\t judges\\t by  their judgment dated  9th\\tJune,  1950,decided the question against the appellants but granted themleave to appeal to this Court As  is\\t well known, during the period of the  war,  profitsarising from a trade or business were much higher1060than the pre-war standard of profits and the State wanted tocatch  a  portion of such profits which it deemed to  be  inexcess\\tof  the\\t normal\\t or  \"standard\"\\t profits.   The\\t Actaccordingly  charges  a tax on the \"excess  profits\"  earnedunder  war conditions and  makes provision, inter alia,\\t forcases  where, as here, there is an increase of capital\\tusedfor  purposes of the business in the  chargeable  accountingperiod.\\t  In  such  cases the standard profits\\tare  to\\t theincreased by an amount calculated by applying the \"statutorypercentage\"  (varying  from 8 to 12 per cent.  in  differentclasses\\t of cases) to the increase in capital.\\t Thus,\\twiththe  increase  in -the capital employed\\t in  the  chargeableaccounting  period,  there  would  be  an  increase  in\\t thestandard profits and a decrease in the excess profits. Wherethe  increase in the capital is brought about with  borrowedmoney,\\tit is but fair that such money,which plays its\\tpartin  earning the larger profits, of which the State claims  asubstantial  share, should not be deducted in computing\\t theaverage capital used for the purposes of the business.\\tRule2-A  of\\t the  Rules  in\\t the  Second  Schedule\\tto  the\\t Actaccordingly  provides that in computing the average  capitalduring\\tthe  chargeable accounting period and  the  relativestandard  period \"no deduction shall be made in\\t respect  ofborrowed money\".  In the present case, the appellants havingadmittedly received no security deposits during the standardperiod, the increase in the average capital employed in\\t thechargeable accounting period would be much greater than whatit  has\\t been  computed\\t to be,\\t if  the  security  depositsreceived, which were all used for the appellants\\'  business,were  treated  as  borrowed money and part  of\\tthe  averagecapital\\t of  their business for\\t the  chargeable  accountingperiod,\\t and  that,  as\\t stated above,\\twould  result  in  aconsiderable   reduction  of  the  excess  profits  as\\t nowassessed.   What then is the true legal character  of  thesesecurity deposits ?\\nThe  sums in question were received by the  appelants  underthree different arrangements with their1061customers  evidenced by the circulars issued to\\t them.\\t Thefirst of these circulars issued on 5th May, 1944, was in thefollowing terms:\\n\"  You are quite aware of the fact that we are and\\twillbe,  so long as the existing contracts of bales are  closed,transferring  the  Contract Advance Deposit amounts  to\\t thecredit of current yarn account for the bales supplied to youthen and there.\\nNow, what we have decided in this connection is not  todo  so\\tas stated above, but to keep  such  advance  amountsunder  the  new heading \" Contracts  Advance  Fixed  DepositAccount\\t \"  and\\t return in cash or by bank\\'s  cheque  or  byinsured\\t post  the advance amount of the  bales\\t booked\\t andsupplied  in full under certain contract number\\t only  aftercompletion of that contract with the bank\\'s commission\\tetc.expenses that may be incurred therein on your account.\\nThe value of the bales delivered or to be delivered foreach  and every time should be paid in full and this  systemis applicable to our future booking of contracts only.\"This  was followed by another issued on 5th December,  1944,which runs thus:\\n\"This is to inform you that we have changed the headingof  your \" Contracts Advance Fixed Deposit \" account into  \"Security  Deposit \" account.  As such, we  have\\t transferredthe  amount  which is to your credit in the  former  to\\t thecredit of your latter account.\\tThis is with effect from 1stNovember, 1944.\\t Kindly note.\"\\nThe\\t arrangement  was  further  modified  by  the\\tlastcircular dated 14th February, 1945, which was in these terms   \"Instead   of  calling  for\\tamounts\\t from  you   towards\\'Security  Deposit  due to bales for which we  are  enteringinto  forward contracts with you and returning the  same  toyou  from the said deposit then and there, as we  are  doingnow,  and in order to make. it feasible, we have decided  todemand\\tfrom you a certain sum towards Security Deposit\\t andkeep the1062same  with  -us\\t so long as our\\t business  connection  underforward contracts will continue with you.    In\\tyour  case, we have fixed a sum of Rs for  the\\tsaiddeposit,  which\\t amount\\t we have to keep  with\\tus  on\\tyourapproval.   Against  the said amount, a sum  of\\t Rs   standscredit\\twith  us now in the said  deposit.   Therefore,\\t thebalance\\t of Rs due by you to you, is to be remitted will  bereturned.  Kindly let us have your reply immediately in thisconnection.\\nPlease  note  that interest of 3 per cent.  per  annumwill  be allowed as usual to the said deposit amounts  untilfurther notice.\"\\nIt  will be seen that before the 5th May, 1944,  whichcovers\\tthe first seven weeks of the  chargeable  accountingperiod,\\t  the\\tappellants  had\\t two   accounts\\t  for\\teachconstituent, namely, a \" contract deposit account \" and a  \"current\\t yarn account \", crediting the moneys received\\tfromthe customers in the former account and transferring them tothe  yarn  account in adjustment of the price of  the  balessupplied  ,then and there\", that is, as and when  deliverieswere  made  under a contract either in\\tinstallments  or  infull.\\tIt  is\\tclear that the\\tamounts\\t received  from\\t thecustomers   under  this\\t arrangement  were  merely   advancepayments of the price which were to be adjusted against\\t thevalue  of  the bales supplied from time to  time  under\\t theforward\\t contracts and they can in no sense be\\tregarded  asborrowed money.\\t This indeed was not disputed by Mr. Pathak.It  was\\t also  conceded\\t by him that  the  circular  of\\t 5thDecember,  1944,  which merely changed the  heading  of\\t theaccount in which the moneys received were credited, did\\t notalter the legal position as it then stood.  Accordingly, thequestion arises only with reference to the amounts  receivedbetween 5th May, 1944, and 14th February, 1945, which coversthe major part of the chargeable accounting period and thosereceived thereafter till the end of that period.\\nIt\\t will be convenient to deal first with\\tthe  amountsreceived during the last part of that period, for, if we1063accept\\tthe  view  of the learned judges  below\\t that  thoseamounts\\t were  not  borrowed money,  then  a  fortiori\\tmustamounts\\t received during the second part be held not  to  beborrowed money.\\nThe circular of the 14th February, 1945,  marksa  clear departure from the mode of dealing followed by\\t theparties before the 5th May, 1944.  The amount deposited by acustomer  was  no longer to have any relation to  the  pricefixed  for  the\\t goods\\tto  be\\tdelivered  under  a  forwardcontract-either in instalments or otherwise.  Such price wasto  be\\tpaid  by the customer in full  against\\tdelivery  inrespect\\t of each contract without any adjustment out of\\t thedeposit, which was to be held by the appellants as  securityfor the due performance of his contracts by the customer  solong  as his dealings with the appellants by way of  forwardcontracts continued, the appellants paying interest at 3 percent.  in  the meanwhile, and having, as  appears  from\\t thecourse of dealings between the parties, the use of the moneyfor  their  own business.  It was only at the end of  the  \"business connection \" with the appellants that an adjustmentwas to be made towards any possible liability arising out ofthe  customer\\'s\\t default.   Apart from\\tsuch  a\\t contingencyarising,  the  appellants undertook to repay  an  equivalentamount\\tat the termination of the dealing.  The\\t transactionhad  thus all the essential elements of a contract of  loan,and we accordingly hold that the deposits received under thefinal arrangement constitute borrowed money for the  purposeof Rule 2-A.\\nThe learned Attorney-General laid great stress on\\t thefact  that  the amounts were deposited with  the  object  ofinducing the appellants to have dealings with the  customersand  for the specific purpose of being held as security\\t forthe  due  performance  by the  customers  of  their  forwardcontracts,  and that the appellants their selves  fixed\\t theamount\\tto  be\\tdeposited in  each  case.   These  features,according  to him, distinguished these transactions  from  areal  borrowing\\t or a real lending which  the  expression  \"borrowed  money \" in Rule 2-A must be taken to connote.\\t  Weare unable to see how1064the  object  which the customers had in view in\\t making\\t thedeposits   can\\taffect\\tthe  essential\\tcharacter   of\\t thetransaction.  If A pays money to B who agrees to return\\t notthe  identical\\tcurrency  in specie but\\t an  equivalent\\t sumsubsequently, no bailment arises but simply a loan owing  byB to A. The fact that it is called a \" deposit \" can make nodifference.  As pointed out by the Judicial Committee of thePrivy  Council\\tin Nawab Major Sir Mohammad  Akbar  Khan  v.Attar Singh (1), the two terms are not mutually\\t exclusive.Adeposit\\t of money is not confined to a bailment of  specificcurrency  to  be returned in specie.  As in the\\t case  of  adeposit\\t with a banker, it does not necessarily involve\\t thecreation of a trust but may involve only the creation of therelation of debtor. and creditor, a loan under conditions \".The  fact  that one of the conditions is that it  is  to  beadjusted  against a claim arising out of a possible  defaultof   the  depositor  cannot  alter  the\\t character  of\\t thetransaction.   Nor can the fact that the purpose  for  whichthe  deposit  is made is to provide a security for  the\\t dueperformance of a collateral contract invest the deposit witha  different  character.   It remains a loan  of  which\\t therepayment  in full is conditioned by the due fulfillment  ofthe obligations under the collateral contract.The  Attorney-General  placed strong reliance,\\tas  did\\t thelearned\\t judges in the High Court, on the English  decisionsin Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Port of London  Authority(2 )and Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Rowntree & Co.\\tLtd.(3).  In the first case it was held that the stock issued bythe  Port  of  London Authority\\t as  consideration  for\\t theacquisition  of\\t the property of certain dock  companies  ofLondon,\\t which\\tcarried interest and  was  redeemable  aftertwenty\\tyears,\\tcould  not be  regarded\\t as  representing  \"borrowed money \" under Rule 2 of Part III of Schedule IV  ofthe  Finance (No. 2) Act, 1915, as that expression  referredto  \"a real borrowing and a real lending \". The\\t transactionwas held to be a purchase of assets for consideration in theshape of the stock issued, though it was attended(1)  (1936) L R. 63 I.A. 279.', '2': 'L.R. [1923] A.C. 507(3) [1948] All E.R. 482.\\nwith incidents in some respects similar to those which wouldhave  ensued  if  there had been a borrowing.  may  well  beconceded that the term \" borrow money \" must be construed inits  natural  and  ordinary  meaning  and  implies  a\\trealborrowing and a real lending.  But the holding that \"  therewas nothing of kind \" in the issue of stock as considerationfor  the purchase of certain assets, where \" no money  passedirectly  or  indirectly between the parties  to  the  tran-saction \" is not of much assistance in determining the issuewhether\\t the  security deposits now in question\\t involved  areal borrowing and a real lending.  For the reasons  alreadyindicated,  we\\tare satisfied that they do  answer  to\\tthatdescription and constitute borrowed money within the meaningof Rule 2-A.\\nThe  other case cited is still less helpful.  Under  certainarrangements for financial facilities, A drew bills on B whoaccepted  them and then, as an agent of A,  discounted\\tthemwith  C and paid over the proceeds to A, who agreed  to\\t puthim  in\\t funds before the maturity of the bills\\t for  payingthem  off.   The Court of Appeal held that  the\\t money\\tthusraised\\twas  not \" borrowed money \" within  the\\t meaning  ofparagraph  2 (1) of Part 11 of the Seventh Schedule  to\\t theFinance\\t (No.  2)  Act,\\t 1939, which  provided\\tthat  \"\\t anyborrowed  money\\t shall\\tbe deducted \" (for  the\\t purpose  ofExcess Profits Duty).  After referring to the Port of Londoncase  (supra)  as authority for the view that  the  words  \"borrowed  money \" require the existence of a borrower and  alender and that there must be a real borrowing in the  legalsense  of the word, the learned judges proceeded to  inquirewho could be the lender, if any, in the circumstances of thecase  and found there was none-not B, for an acceptor  of  abill  need not have any money in his hands at all  to  lend,not  C\\twho was only acquiring certain rights  in  the\\tbillunder  the  law merchant but was not  lending  money.\\tTheyaccordingly found it \" impossible to discover that there wassuch  a\\t relationship  \" (of  lender  and  borrower)  eitherbetween A and B or between A and C. In the1381066present\\t case, the relationship of lender and  borrower\\t  inall  its essential features is plainly recognisable  betweenthe  depositors and the appellants, and that  decision\\tdoesnot affect the matter one way or the other.\\nOn the other hand, a more recent decision of the  EnglishCourt of Appeal in Davies v. The Shell Company of China (1),which  Mr. Pathak brought to our notice, is more in.  point.A  British Company, which sold petroleum products  in  Chinathrough Chinese agents, required the latter to deposit\\twiththe company a sum of money in Chinese dollars to be held  assecurity  against possible default by the agent\\t in  paymentfor the products consigned to them and to be repaid when theagency came to an end.\\tThese deposits were, during the war,transferred to the United Kingdom for reasons of safety\\t andwere there held in sterling.  Subsequently, when the Chinesedollar\\tdepreciated  in relation to  sterling,\\tthe  amountsrequired to repay the deposits in Chinese dollars were\\tmuchless  than  the\\t sums  held  by\\t the  company  as   sterlingequivalents of the deposits, and the question arose  whethersuch deposits were trading receipts or receipts of a capitalnature.\\t In holding that they were capital receipts and\\t theprofit\\twas  therefore\\ta capital gain,\\t Jenkins  L.J.,\\t whodelivered the leading judgment, observed :\\n\"If\\t the agent\\'s deposit had in truth been a payment  inadvance to be applied by the company in discharging the sumsfrom time to time due from the agent in respect of petroleumproducts transferred to the agent and sold by him, the\\tcasemight well be difficult and might well fall within the ratiodecidendi of Landes Bros. v. Simpson(1) and Imperial TobaccoCo.  v. Kelley.(1) But that is not the character of the\\t de-posits\\there in question.  The intention manifested  by\\t theterms  of  the\\tagreement  is that  the\\t deposit  should  beretained  by the company, carrying interest for the  benefitof the depositor throughout the terms of the agency.  It  isto be available during the(1)  (1951) 32 Tax Cas, I33.\\t(3) (1943) 25 Tax Cas. 292.(2)  (1934) 19 Tax Cas. 62.\\nderiod of the agency for making good the agent\\'s pefaults inthe  event of any default by him; but otherwise it  remains,as  I see it, simply as a loan owing by the company  to\\t theagent and repayable on the termination of the agency; and  Ido  not\\t see how the fact that the purpose for which  it  isgiven is to provide a security against any possible  defaultby  the agent can invest it with the character of a  tradingreceipt.\"\\nThe  Attorney-General  relied also  upon  certain  decisionsholding that security deposits received from employees\\twereimpressed with a fiduciary character so that the  depositorswere entitled to preferential payments from the assignee  inbankruptcy  of\\tthe depositee.\\tHe admitted,  however,\\tthatthere  were decisions holding the other way, and we  do\\t notthink  it necessary to discuss that class of cases,  as\\t themanner\\tin which such sums have to be dealt with  under\\t theInsolvency  Acts has no direct bearing on the  question\\t nowunder consideration.\\nTurning  now to the deposits received by the  appellantsfrom  5th  May,\\t 1944, to 14th February,  1945,\\t we  are  ofopinion that, having regard to the terms of the\\t arrangementthen  in force, they partake more of the nature\\t of  tradingreceipts  than of security deposits.  It will be  seen\\tthatthe  amounts  received were treated as advance\\tpayments  inrelation to each \"contract number\" and though the  agreementprovided  for  the  payment  of the price  in  full  by\\t thecustomer  and for the deposit being returned to him  on\\t thecompletion  of delivery under the contract, the\\t transactionis one providing in substance and effect for the  adjustmentof the mutual obligations on the completion of the contract.We  hold  accordingly  that the sums  received\\tduring\\tthisperiod cannot be regarded as borrowed money for the purposesof Rule 2-A.\\nLastly,  Mr.  Pathak  suggested that  the\\tcase  havingproceeded both before the Excess Profits Tax authorities andthe High Court on the footing that if the sums received fromthe  customers during any part of the chargeable  accountingperiod were held to be borrowed1068money,\\tthey  must  be included in the\\tcomputation  of\\t theaverage profits for the whole. of the chargeable  accountingperiod,\\t no distinction should now be made between one\\tpartof  the\\t period\\t and another for this  purpose.\\t  We  cannotaccept\\tthat  view.   It  is  true  to\\tsay  that  no\\tsuchdistinction  was in fact made at any stage so far, but\\tthatis because it was held that none of the sums received  underany  of\\t the  arrangements was\\tborrowed  money\\t within\\t themeaning of Rule 2-A.  But, if it be held that the a  \\'mountsreceived  under one or more, but not all, of the  agreementsare  borrowed  moneys, then, obviously, the  computation  ofaverage\\t capital in accordance with Rule 2-A must take\\tintoaccount\\t the different character of the sums received  undereach of the agreements which was in force during a part onlyof  the\\t chargeable  accounting period.\\t  The  form  of\\t thequestion  referred to the court clearly recognises this\\t andadmits\\tof a distinction being made, if\\t necessary,  betweenparts of the chargeable accounting period.\\nIn the result we set aside the order of the court belowand  answer  the question referred in the  affirmative\\twithreference  to  the last part of\\t the  chargeable  accountingperiod,\\t namely, 14th February, 1945, to 12th  April,  1945,and  in\\t the  negative with reference to the  rest  of\\tthatperiod.\\t We make to order as to costs.\\nOrder set aside.\\nAgent for the appellants: Naunit Lal.\\nAgent for the respondent: O.

If in any549particular State there is only one Judicial Commissioner  asthe ultimate appellate authority, and if the confirmation ofsentence of death has to be made by him, the procedure\\tlaiddown  must be followed.\\t The fact that there is not a  Benchof  two\\t Judges\\t as in the High Courts to  deal\\t with  deathsentences  is  not  an adequate ground\\tfor  converting\\t theSupreme\\t  Court\\t into  an  ordinary  court  of\\tappeal\\t andconfirmation  in such matters.\\tIt is unnecessary,  however,to  pursue  this subject further, as we have heard  the\\t twoappeals on their merits is well.\\nThere is no substance in the constitutional points sought tobe raised on behalf of the appellants.\\tBoth the  appellantshave  made  confessions of their guilt which  were  recordedunder  section\\t164,  Criminal\\tProcedure  Code,  but\\ttheyretracted  them in the Committing Magistrate\\'s\\tcourt.\\t Theconfessions were used against them at the sessions trial andin  their examination under section 342, Criminal  ProcedureCode.\\t Each  was  asked  about  certain  details  of\\t theconfession made by the other.\\nIt was contended that if an accused person retracted his  orher confession, it should not be used against him or her  atall, as it would contravene article 20 (3)   of\\t\\t theConstitution, which provides that no person  accused of\\t anyoffence shall be compelled to be a witness against  himself.It  is\\tdifficult  to  see  the\\t force\\tof  this  point.   Aconfession has to be voluntary before it can be used againsta  person  making it and a magistrate is  bound\\t to  satisfyhimself that it is being made without any inducement, threator promise.  No person accused of a crime is bound to make aconfession, and if there is any compulsion or threat, it hasto be ruled out as irrelevant and inadmissible.\\t Sub-section(3) of article 20 does not apply at all to a case where\\t theconfession  is\\tmade  without  any  inducement,\\t threat\\t  orpromise.   It is true that a retracted confession  has\\tonlylittle\\tvalue  as the basis for a conviction, and  that\\t theconfession  of\\tone accused is not evidence  against  a\\t co-accused tried jointly for the same offence, but can only  betaken550into  consideration  against  him.   This  deals  with\\t itsprobative value and has nothing to do with any repugnancy tothe Constitution.\\nIt  was also urged that as sub-clause (2) of article  20  ofthe Constitution provides that no person shall be prosecutedand  punished  for  the same offence  more  than  once,\\t theGovernment  cannot  have  any right  of\\t appeal\\t against  anacquittal.   If there is no punishment for the offence as  aresult\\t of   the  prosecution,\\t the  sub-section   has\\t  noapplication  ; and secondly, an appeal against an  acquittalwherever such is provided by the procedure is in substance acontinuation   of  the\\tprosecution.   Mr.  Tarachand,\\t whoappeared  for  Kalawati, ultimately desisted  from  pursuingthese constitutional objections and addressed himselfto the merits.\\t\\t\\t\\t     I\\n-A few facts and dates maybe set out here as relevant to theproper appreciation of the arguments addressed on behalf  ofthe  appellants.  The murder took place, as already  stated,on  the open roof of Bikram Singh\\'s haveli about 4 a. m.  on16th July, 1951.  Mst.\\tShibbi (P.W.3) who was a cook in thefamily\\tand  who was sleeping on the same roof at  a  littledistance  was the first -to wake up on hearing some  strangenoise,\\tand she saw a man going away from near her  bed\\t andgetting\\t down  the  ladder at the back of  the\\thouse.\\t Sheraised a hue and cry and found Bikram Singh fallen down from\\'his bed with his face downwards.  The other servants in thehouse, namely, Jora and Dayaram and P.W.3\\'s husband,  Nathu,who were all sleeping downstairs, came on to the roof.\\t OneLaik  Ram also arrived with a gas light.  Kalawati  who\\t wassleeping by the side of her husband was not in her bed;\\t shewas standing in the room near the steps.  It was  discoveredthat  Bikram  Singh had been the victim of a  fatal  attack.The  commotion reached the ears of P.W.7, who lived at\\tsomedistance, and he shouted to the police station near by.\\t Hiscries  brought\\ton  the\\t scene,\\t at  about  4-40  a.m.\\t thehead  constable (P.W. 24) to whom Kalawati made a  statementto the551effect\\tthat  some unknown dacoits had\\tinvaded\\t her  house,killed her husband and robbed her of her jewels.  As he\\t wasproceeding   with  the\\tinvestigation,\\t the   station-houseofficer, Solan, (P.W. 38) arrived and took it up.Various\\t articles  were\\t recovered  in\\tthe  course  of\\t theinvestigation.\\tA scabbard was discovered on 16th July,1951,itself\\tby  P.W. 19 at a distance of one  furlong  from\\t thehouse of the deceased.\\tTwo days later, i.e., on 18th  July,1951,  a shirt and a kachha were discovered by P.W. 22\\tfromunderneath  a stone in a water channel about a mile  furtheraway.  On 24th July, 1951, Ranjit Singh was arrested, and itis stated that he took the police and took out a sword\\tfroma bush to the west of the place of occurrence at a  distanceof 100 yards.  Some bushes had to be out at the instance  ofthe  accused  before  the  sword  was  discovered.   Certainornaments,  thirty-five\\t in number, and said  to  belong  toKalawati  were\\tunearthed  by the accused  himself  on\\t27thOctober,  1951, from a room of his house in Basdhera.\\tTheywere  all in a metal box, and the box was in an earthen\\t potwhich lay buried in the earth.\\nKalawati  made a confession on 28th July, 1951,\\t before\\t theMagistrate, Sri Antani (P.W. 31).  The confession of  RanjitSingh  was  recorded by the same Magistrate on\\t3rd  August,1951.\\nThe  material  evidence in the case consists  of  these\\t twoconfessions  and  the  evidence given  by  the\\tmaidservant,Shibbi\\t(P.W.  3).  The other evidence\\tadduced\\t relates  tomotive and the several discoveries, on which the prosecutionrelies\\t as  corroborative  circumstances  to  support\\t thesubstantial  truth of the confessions, which were  retractedeven   before\\tthe  Committing\\t Magistrate  by\\t  both\\t theappellants.\\nIt  is\\tabundantly  clear  that\\t the  relationship   betweenKalawati  and  her  deceased  husband,\\tBikram\\tSingh,\\t wasstrained.  As early as 1946, she had complained against\\t himof  violence  and threat to kill, and his arms\\tlicence\\t wascancelled.  He was addicted to drink,552and  often  used to quarrel with her  and  ill-treated\\ther.Since  1948  or thereabouts, Ranjit Singh,  &  fairly  closerelation, entered into the picture as a frequent visitor  atManimajra  or Bishanpura.  He. developed intimate  relationswith Kalawati, which led to suspicion of her misconduct withhim.  The evidence of Balbir Singh, brother of the deceased,Baldev\\tSingh,\\tthe  manager of\\t the  estate,  and  Dropadi,mistress of the father of the deceased, examined as P.Ws. 1,2  and 5 respectively, establishes this.  In her  confessionmarked\\tExhibit P.A.A., Kalawati points out how and why\\t herrelations  with her husband became strained, and  refers  toher  liaison with Ranjit Singh, the conspiracy between\\tthemto  get\\t rid  of Bikram Singh, the plan laid  out  for\\tthispurpose,  and the fatal assault early in the morning of\\t the16th July.  She throws the entire blame on Ranjit Singh,  towhose  scheme  she  agreed, out of  sheer  disgust  for\\t herhusband.   She tells us that she made a confession so as  toremove the load of sinfulness from her soul.The  confession of Ranjit Singh, Exhibit P.A.C.,  which\\t wasalso  retracted, is more or less on the same lines,  but  hesays that Kalawati was primarily responsible for the scheme,and he concludes it thus:\\n\"Had  Kalawati\\tnot asked me, I would not  have\\t thought  ofmurdering Kanwar.\\nThe  fault of worsening the relations between  Kalawati\\t andKanwar lies on the Kanwar.  He had illicit connections\\twithhis father\\'s keep.\"\\nHe  admits that he inflicted the injuries found\\t on  BikranaSingh  with a sword.  Before the Committing  Magistrate,  hedid  not impeach this confession in any manner when  he\\t wasexamined  under section 342.  But in the Sessions  Court  hewent back on it as regards every material detail almost, andstated\\tthat it was entirely dictated to the  Magistrate  bytwo  police  Sub-Inspectors,  and  that\\t be  was  a  passivelistener  to what they said.  He signed the document  out,offear as the police had beaten him.\\nShibbi, who on the fatal night was sleeping at some distanceon the same terrace with Bikram Singh and Kalawati, woke  upon hearing a slashy noise, and found Ranjit Singh pass\\tnearher bed and going down the ladder at the back of the  house.She raised shouts, and the servants who were sleeping in thecourtyard  downstairs came up.\\tKalawati was  standing\\tnearthe  steps  of an adjoining room.  When she  told  her\\tthatRanjit\\tSingh was running away Kalawati denied that  it\\t wasRanjit\\tSingh,\\tand stated that some dacoits  had  come\\t androbbed\\ther of her ornaments.  Her evidence was accepted  bythe courts below, and there is a ring of truth about it.  Ifshe  was a false witness, there was nothing to\\tprevent\\t herfrom saying that she saw Ranjit Singh attacking Bikram Singhwith  a\\t sword.\\t But she tells us that she did not  see\\t thecommission  of the murder, and saw only the back  of  RanjitSingh  when he was hurrying down at a distance of a yard  orso  from her bed.  She could not identify the weapon in\\t hishand,  except to the extent of stating that he\\twas  holdingsomething shining.  It is true that she did not mention\\t thename  of  Ranjit  Singh\\t at any time  earlier  than  in\\t theCommitting Magistrate\\'s court, but this was because Kalawatihad scolded her and asked her to keep quiet.  The suggestionthat  her husband, Nathu, was probably responsible  for\\t themurder,\\t as  his  hands were  admittedly  bloodstained\\twhenpeople\\thad gathered there, is unlikely.  He had  no  motivewhatever to kill his master.  It might well be that when  hecame up along with the servants and the crowd had  gathered,he  came into touch with the body in ascertaining  what\\t hadhappened or for giving water to the injured man in his\\tlastgasp,  about  which there is some  evidence.   Kalawati\\t hadgiven  the police a story of an attack by dacoits, and\\ttillthe   investigation  advanced,\\tit  is\\tonly  natural\\tthatsuspicion  should  have fastened itself on  several  people.Laik Ram, a shopkeeper, who carries on his business oppositethe  place of occurrence, who was examined as P.W. 23,\\ttoldthe police that he suspected many sets of people554\\n-namely,Shibbiand  Nathu,  Kalawati, a Sikh servant  of\\t thedeceased, Balbir Singh, the brother of the deceased himself,and  the driver, who was formerly a Sub-Inspector,  and\\t twoSikhs  who  were seen in the jungle at\\t8  p.m.the  previousnight.\\nApart from the confessions, there are definite circumstanceswhich indicate beyond reasonable  doubt the guilt of  RanjitSingh.\\t He  is a resident of Bashdera, but  his  sword\\t andscabbard were found near the place of occurrence, and it washe  who\\t recovered  the\\t sword\\tfrom  a\\t bush.\\t His   kacha(underwear)  remained concealed under a stone in  a  channelnear  the place of occurrence.\\tKalawati herself  stated  inher  confession that the kachha seemed to belong  to  RanjitSingh,\\tas she knew he had purchased the cloth, and  it\\t wassewn on her own sewing machine and in her presence at  Mani-majra.\\nMore important is the discovery of the ornaments of Kalawation  29th  July, \\'1951, in the presence of Ranjit  Singh\\t andwith his assistance.  They were buried underneath the  earthin  a room of his house in Bashdera.  It was urged  that  asthe  room was an open one with no doors and no\\troof,it\\t wasprobable  they were planted there.  According to  Kalawati\\'sconfession,  she  had left them at Manimajra, and  she\\tsaysthat  Baldev  Singh, the manager, had the  keys,  suggestingthereby\\t that  he might have handed over the jewels  to\\t thepolice\\tfor  implantation.  Ranjit tells us that as  he\\t wasbeing  taken to Bishanpura in a jeep, Baldev handed them  tothe Sub-Inspector, Prithiram.  We are not prepared to differfrom  the Judicial Commissioner on this point.\\t Baldev\\t wasnot  asked a single question in cross-examination about\\t hisenmity\\twith  Kalawati and there was no\\t suggestion  why  heshould have colluded with the police in the manner  alleged.The Sub-Inspector was not asked either about Ranjit  Singh\\'sallegation.  Much argument was addressed to the effect\\tthatit  was\\t not  at all likely that Ranjit\\t Singh\\twould  have,buried\\tthe ornaments in his own house and in an open  room,and that if he555wanted\\tto  conceal  traces  of the  crime,  he\\t would\\thaveconcealed them elsewhere.  The ornaments had to be  returnedin  all\\t probability, and he might have thought\\t that  theircareful preservation was his duty.  Had he concealed them ina locked room or box, it would have been much more  damagingto  him\\t if  they were discovered by the  police  who  wouldinevitably search his house.  It was not till the evening ofthe 27th that Kalawati made a confessions to the  police,andthere  was  hardly  any time for them to take  hold  of\\t theornaments from Manimajra, proceed to Basdhera, implant\\tthemin the house of Ranjit Singh, return to Bishanpura, and takeRanjit\\tto his house on the 29th so that he could  show\\t theplace  of concealment.\\tWe are not prepared to\\tdiffer\\tfromthe   learned  Judicial\\t Commissioner,\\twho   rejected\\t thecriticisms  of\\tthe Sessions Judge about this  recovery\\t andaccepted the prosecution story as true.\\nAs regards Kalawati the case is suspicious, no doubt.  It ispossible  that\\tshe, aided and abetted Ranjit Singh  in\\t thecriminal deed.\\tBut we think it is possible also that thoughshe  was aware of the intentions of Ranjit  Singh  expressedfrom  time to time for the sake of protecting her from\\till-treatment and cruelty at the hands of her husband, she mightnot  have believed that he was going to put his threat\\tintoactual\\texecution.  As pointed out already in more than\\t oneplace, each of the accused charges the other with the activeformulation  of\\t the scheme to get rid\\tof  an\\tinconvenientobstacle  and  a  cruel\\t brute.\\t  There\\t is  one  defect  inKalawati\\'s  confession\\twhich  might  be  noticed  here.   Acareful\\t scrutiny  of it leads to the  conclusion  that\\t thefinal  hatching of the plot was on the afternoon of the\\t 8thJuly, and that the entrustment of the ornaments into  RanjitSingh\\'s\\t hands\\twas on the morning of the 9th.\\tThis  is  inapparent  conflict with the diary of Bikram Singh marked  P.W.  38/3,  where there is this entry under the date  of\\t 8thJuly : \"Ranjit Singh gone to Simla for his personal work  toenquire\\t about\\this  application.   Then  he  will   proceedManimaira\" If this is correct, the story of72556the  plot  on  the 8th and the entrustment  on\\tthe  9th  issomewhat  damaged, unless. it was possible for Ranjit  Singhto  go\\tto Simla on the afternoon of the 8th and  return  toBishanpura  on\\tthe  morning of the 9th,  on  which  aspect,however, there is no evidence one way or the other.  We haveto  assume that the 8th of July was the date of\\t the  secrettalk  between Kalawati and Ranjit Singh from the \\'fact\\tthatBalbir\\tSingh (P.  W. 1) says that he left  Bishanpura\\tfor-Manimajra with the children on the 7th of July, and she saysthat the arrangement was on the day after the children left.There may be some mistake about the dates.\\nApart  from  this infirmative, circumstance,  there  is\\t yetanother,   which  renders  it  unsafe  to  take\\t  Kalawati\\'sconfession  at its face value.\\tShe was prepared to  make  aconfession  on the 27th evening, and she was actually  takento  the\\t Magistrate.   Not only was she\\t prepared,  but\\t sheinsisted  on making it, and there was no  particular  reasonwhy  the  recording  was postponed to  the  next  day.\\t Shealleges\\t that the SubInspector asked for time  stating\\tthather  condition was bad, and she should be given 12 hours  tothink over it.\\tThe confession contains minute details whichwould  not  normally find a place in such a  document.\\t Forinstance,, she says :\\nWe had become so close that I ban claim to have seen all hisclothes,  because he used to keep his boxes usually with  meand  his room was also next to mine.  He may not  have\\tseenall my clothes, but those that I wore must have been seen byhim.  Normally he would have seen only the jewellers which Iwore.  He had not known of my jewellery box.\"The  conversation between Kalawati and Ranjit Singh  in\\t thepresence of a maid-servant near the well where she had\\tgoneto  wash  her  clothes\\tis  rather  incredible.\\t  For  thesereasons, we hesitate to act upon the confession of  Kalawatiand  find her guilty of aiding and abetting the\\t offence  ofmurder.\\nBut  there  can\\t scarcely be any doubt that  she  must\\thavewitnessed the murder of her husband lying next557to  her\\t on a charpai.\\tShibbi who was at a distance  of  18feet  was roused by the sound of a .;word attack.   Kalawatimust  have  woke up also at least during the course  of\\t theassault if not at its commencement, several injuries  havingbeen   inflicted  in  succession.   When  Shibbi  woke\\t up,Kalawati\\'s bed was empty, and she wag found in a room nearbyand  not  at the place of occurrence.  She  trotted  out  anelaborate  story  of dacoity, which cannot  be\\taccepted  astrue.  Even if in terror she ran away from her bed and stoodat  a .distance, she is almost sure to have, known  who\\t wasthe  offender, unless lie bad his face muffled.\\t  The  firstversion\\t she  gave  to the police  head\\t constable  when  heappeared  on the scene immediately after the occurrence\\t is,we  think,  false, and we are of opinion that  she  knew  orbelieved  it to be false.  The border line between  abetmentof  the offence and giving false information to\\t screen\\t theoffender  is rather thin in her case, but it is\\t prudent  toerr  oil  the  safe side, and hold her\\tguilty\\tonly  of  anoffence under section 20-1, Indian Penal Code as the learnedSessions Judge did.\\nIt was urged for her by Mr. Mathur that as she was acquittedof  this offence by the Judicial Commissioner, and as  therehas been no appeal by the Government against the  acquittal,she cannot now be convicted of the same by this Court.\\tThisargument  proceeds  on\\ta  fallacy.   Section  201  is\\t notrestricted  to the case of a person who screens\\t the  actualoffender  it can be applied even to a person guilty  of\\t themain  offence, though as a matter of practice a Court  -willnot  convict  a person both of the main\\t offence  and  undersection\\t 201.  The Judicial Commissioner acquitted  Kalawatiof the offence under section 201 for which she was convictedby the Sessions Judge, only because he thought that the mainoffence\\t itself,  namely, murder, was brought home  to\\ther.But  if we think for the reasons given above that  it  wouldnot  be\\t safe  to  convict her\\tof  the\\t main  offence,\\t theacquittal  is  no legal impediment to her  conviction  undersection 201.  It was held by the Privy Council558in Begu v. King-Emperor(1) that in a charge of murder  undersection 302 a conviction under section 201 without a furthercharge being made was warranted by the provisions of section237,   Criminal\\t Procedure  Code.   If\\tKalawati  had\\tbeenacquitted  of an offence under section 201 independently  ofthe  charge  of\\t murder against her, it would  have  been  adifferent  matter.   But as her acquittal is  so  intimatelyrelated\\t to the charge of the main offence, and as  it\\ttookplace  only  for  the reason that she  was  held  guilty  ofmurder, there is no bar to the restoration of the convictionunder section 201.\\nThe  result is that Ranjit Singh\\'s Appeal No. 74 of 1952  isdismissed,  but we substitute for the sentence of death\\t thesentence  of transportation for life, having regard  to\\t thetime  that  has\\t now elapsed since the\\toccurrence  and\\t theprobable  motive  of  prevention of cruelty  to\\t a  helplesswoman.\\tKalawati\\'s Appeal No. 73 of 1952 is allowed, and herconviction and sentence under section 302 discharged, but weconvict\\t her of am offence under section 201,  Indian  PenalCode,\\tand   sentence\\t her  to   three   years\\'   rigorousimprisonment.\\nAppeal No. 73 allowed.\\nAppeal No. 74 dismissed.

The trial  courtdecided\\t this point in favour of the plaintiffs,  while\\t theHigh Court has taken a contrary view in appeal.The subject-matter of dispute is one-third share of shebaitiright in respect of a private debutter dedicated to an\\tidolknown  by  the name of Dakshineshwar Jew and situated  at  avillage called Dhop Dhopi within the district of 24-Parganasin West Bengal.\\t The deity is an ancient one and its reputedfounder and first shebait was one Udhab Chandra Pandit.\\t  Itis not disputed that by successive devolutions the rights ofthe  shebait came to vest in one Iswar Chandra\\tChakroborti,who  was  the common ancestor of the parties to\\t this  suit.The  following\\tgenealogical  table  will  make\\t clear\\t therelationship  of the several persons who figure as  parties.to the present litigation as between themselves and also  totheir common ancestor.\\nIswar  died  leaving  six sons as his heirs  and  they\\twereAshutosh,  Govinda, Gopal, Sadananda, Trailokhya and  Haran.These  six  sons when they divided the properties  of  theirfather, divided the shebaiti right also which devolved\\tuponthem  in  six  equal shares, and this division\\twas  by\\t themethod known as palas or turns of worship, which means\\tthatto  each  one  of  the\\tsons  was  allotted  the  right\\t  ofworshipping  the  deity for 5 days every  month\\t and  duringthese  days he alone was to discharge the functions  of\\t theshebait\\t and receive the emoluments attached to the  office.Gradually, a custom grew up in the family according to whichthese palas could be bought and sold or otherwise  alienatedamongst\\t the members of the shebait\\'s family.  Govinda,\\t whowas  the father of the plaintiffs and who got 5, days\\'\\tpalaevery month in his share, sold his interest in the  shebaitito  Haran, a brother of his, and the result was\\t that  Haranacquired 10 days\\' pala every mouth or one-third share in theentire shebaiti right.\\tHaran died without any issue leavinghim  surviving, his widow Rajlakshmi as his sole heir  underthe  Hindu  law and Rajlakshmi continued to hold  this\\tone-third share of shebaiti right along with other properties ofthe  deceased.\\t On 17th June, 1920, Rajlakshmi\\t granted  anijara lease of her shebaiti right for a term of two years toone Satish Chandra Dey.\\t On 1st of April, 1921, Satish\\tsoldthis  leasehold interest in respect to the palas to one\\t RamRakhal Ghose.\\nPrevious  to  that, on 6th of August, 1920, Ram\\t Rakhal\\t hadhimself taken a lease from Rajlakshmi of her shebaiti  rightfor a period of 5 years, this lease to commence at the closeof  the\\t previous  lease in favour of  Satish.\\t Ram  Rakhaladmittedly got possession of the office of shebait and beganto exercise his rights as such on and from the 1st of April,1921.\\tBy a deed of conveyance dated the 7th  of  November,1921,  Rajlakshmi made an out and out sale of  her  shebaitiright  in  favour of Ram Rakhal and twenty days\\t after\\tthispurchase, that is to say, on 27th November, 1921, Ram Rakhalin his turn sold this interest to Nagendra and Surendra, twoof  the\\t sons  of  Trailokhya.\\t Surendra  died\\t some\\ttimeafterwards  and\\t on 20th of June, 1925, his  widow  Tarakalisold her husband\\'s share in the shebaiti right to  Nagendra,her husband\\'s brother.\\tThus Nagendra in addition to what hehad inherited from his own father came to hold the  entiretyof  a third share in the shebaiti right, represented  by  10days\\' pala every mouth, which was previously hold by  Haran.Rajlakshmi  died  on  22nd  December,  1943,  and  the\\t twoplaintiffs, who are the two surviving sons of Govinda, filedthe  suit  out of which this appeal arises for\\trecovery  ofpossession of this one-third shebaiti right of Haran on\\t theallegation  that  they were the next heirs of Haran  at\\t thetime of Rajlakshmi\\'s death.\\nNagendra  had  died in the meantime and the  first  and\\t theprincipal defendant in the suit is his daughter Palani Bala,who  is\\t a  minor  and is  represented\\tby  her\\t husband  asguardian.   The\\t second defendant is the receiver,  who\\t hasbeen placed in charge of the properties of Palani Bala in  aguardianship proceeding pending before the District Judge of24Parganas.   The  defendants  3 and  4\\t are  the  survivingdescendants of Iswar who hold the remaining interest in\\t theshebaiti right.\\nThe  case of the plaintiffs, in substance, is that the\\tone-third  share of the shebaiti right, which was held by  Haranduring his lifetime, devolved upon his widow Rajlakshmi\\t whohad only the restricted rights508of  a Hindu widow in respect to the same.  On the  death  ofthe  widow, the interest vested in the plaintiffs. who\\twerethe  nearest  heirs  of Haran at the  time  of\\tRajlakshmi\\'sdeath.\\t  They,\\t  accordingly,\\tprayed\\tfor-being   put\\t  inpossession  of\\tthis one-third share of the  shebaiti  rightrepresented,  as  stated aforesaid, by 10  days\\t pala  everymonth  after evicting the defendant No. 1 therefrom.   Therewas  a\\tclaim also for mesne profits from the  date  of\\t thewidow\\'s\\t death.\\t In the plaint a description has been  givenof  the\\t temple,  its  appurtenant lands  and  also  of\\t thestructures  standing thereupon, but there is no\\t prayer\\t forpossession in respect of these properties.The  suit was resisted on behalf of defendant No. 1 and\\t themain contention raised was that as the sale of her  shebaitiright  by  Rajlakshmi,\\tthe  widow  of\\tHaran,\\twas  a\\tvoidtransaction   which  did  not  create  any  right   in\\t thetransferee,  the possession of Ram Rakhal and after him\\t hisvendees, who were the predecessors of defendant No. 1 ,\\t wasadverse\\t against all the shebaits, and the defendant  No.  1consequently  acquired an -indefeasible title to this  thirdshare  in the shebaiti right by adverse possession  and\\t theplaintiffs\\'  suit was barred by limitation.   Several  othercontentions  were raised but they are not material  for\\t ourpresent purpose.\\nThe  trial  Judge by his judgment dated the  22nd  December\\'1948,  overruled the pleas \\'taken by the defendant and\\tgavethe plaintiffs a decree.  On the question of limitation, theSubordinate  Judge  held that although article\\t141  of\\t theIndian\\tLimitation Act was not attracted to this  cage,\\t yetthe  plaintiffs\\'  suit was not barred  by  limitation.\\t Tworeasons have been assigned for this view.  It has been\\tsaidin the first place that Nagendra purported to purchase\\tonlythe  life interest of Rajlakshmi; consequently his  positionas  purchaser  was  in recognition of the  interest  of\\t thereversionary  heirs  of Haran.\\tIt is said further  that  asRajlakshmi and Nagendra were both co-shebaits of the  deity,the possession of the latter could not have been adverse  tothe former,509they being in the position of co-sharers in law and  nothinglike ouster being alleged or proved in this case.Against this judgment, the defendants 1 and 2 took an appealto  the\\t Calcutta High Court and the appeal was heard  by  aDivision  Bench consisting of Das and Guha JJ.\\tThe  learnedJudges while affirming all the other findings arrived at  bythe trial judge disagreed with the latter on the question oflimitation.   It was held by the High Court that the  properarticle\\t to  apply  in\\tthis case was  article\\t124  of\\t theLimitation  Act,  and  as  the\\tdefendant  No.\\t1  and\\t herpredecessors had been in possession of the hereditary officeof  the shebait adversely to the plaintiff for more than  12years prior to the institution of the suit, the\\t plaintiffs\\'claim was barred by limitation.\\t In this view, the  judgmentof  the\\t trial court was reversed and the  plaintiffs\\'\\tsuitdismissed.\\nThe only point canvassed before us in this appeal is that oflimitation and the arguments that have been advanced  beforeus on this point by the learned counsel on both sides reallyraise  two questions for our determination.  The  first\\t is,whether\\t on  the facts of the present case  the\\t plaintiffs\\'suit  is  governed  by article 124 or  article\\t141  of\\t theLimitation Act ? If article 141 is the appropriate  article,it is not disputed that the plaintiffs\\' suit is well  withintime;  but  if -article 124 is applicable, the\\tother  pointthat would require consideration is, when did the  defendantor her predecessors take possession of the hereditary officeof   shebait  adversely\\t to  the  plaintiffs  ?\\t Was   theirpossession  adverse  from the very date of the\\ttransfer  byRajlakshmi or did it become so only at her death ?The  proposition is well established that the alienation  ofthe  shebaiti right by a shebait in favour of a stranger  isabsolutely void in Hindu law and cannot be validated even onthe  footing  of  a custom.  The alienee of  the  right\\t is,therefore,  a trespasser out and, out and his possession  asagainst\\t the transferor is adverse from the very  beginning.Mr.  Chatterjee appearing for the plaintiffs appellants\\t hasnot assailed510the  correctness of this proposition of law; his  contentionis that the possession of shebaiti right by defendant No.  1and  her  predecessors\\tmight  have  been  adverse   againstRajlakshmi  ever  since\\t the date of  transfor\\tand  on\\t thestrength  of  such  possession they might  have\\t acquired  astatutory  title  against  her in respect  of  the  shebaitiinterest  ;  but such adverse possession for more  than\\t thestatutory period though it might bar the widow would not barthe  reversioners  who\\tdo not derive their  title  from  or\\n-through her.  This, it is said, is the principle underlyingthe  law of limitation in India ever since 1871 and  article141  of\\t the Limitation Act expressly recognises  and  giveseffect\\tto it.\\tIt is contended by Mr. Chatterjee that\\tevenif  article 141 does not apply to the facts of\\tthe  presentcase and article 124 is taken to be the appropriate article,the  plaintiffs\\'  suit\\twould be quite within  time  as\\t thedefendant  or  her predecessors must be held to\\t have  takenpossession  of\\tthe office of the shebait adversely  to\\t thepresent\\t plaintiffs only when the widow died and not  beforethat.\\nOn the other hand, it has been argued by Mr. Panchanan Ghosethat  there is nothing like a general principle of law\\tthatadverse\\t possession  against  a Hindu  widow  could  not  bereckoned  as  adverse possession against  her  reversionary-heirs.\\tThat, it is said, is only a special rule which restsentirely upon the particular provision of article 141 of theLimitation  Act\\t and is confined in its operation  to  caseswhich come within the purview of that article.\\tMr.  Ghose\\'scontention  is\\tthat article 141 has no application  to\\t thefacts  of this case and consequently there is no reason\\t forholding that adverse possession against the widow if it\\t wascontinued  for\\tthe  statutory\\tperiod\\twould  not  bar\\t thereversionary  heirs also.  This, he says, was the law  priorto the introduction of article 141 into the statute book andthat  is the law which governs all cases even now  which  donot  directly  come under that\\tarticle.   According.to\\t thelearned\\t counsel, article .124 is the proper  article  whichgoverns\\t this case and the possession of the transferee\\t of,the511shebaiti  interest being admittedly adverse to -the,  holderof  the\\t office\\t at the date of the transfer,  it  would  beadverse\\t against  the next holder also,\\t no  matter  whetherstrictly  he derives his title from the previous  holder  ornot.   It is urged that in the case of a  hereditary  officelike  that of a shebait, the powers of a female shebait\\t arein  no way more restricted than those of a male shebait\\t andas  the\\t trust\\testate during the  incumbency  of  a  femaleshebait\\t resides in her completely and effectually as  in  amale  trustee, the male trustee who comes after\\t her  cannotclaim the benefit of the principle upon which article 141 ofthe  Limitation\\t Act is founded.  The points raised  are  nodoubt important and require careful examination.It may be mentioned at the outset that in the old LimitationAct  (Act  XXIV\\t of 1859) there was  no\\t specific  provisionrelating to suits by reversioners for recovery of possessionof  property held by a Hindu widow in her restricted  right.There  were  provisions\\t only of a  most  general  charactercontained  in  sections 12 and 16 of the  Act,\\tunder  whichlimitation  for\\t suits\\tto  recover  immovable\\tand  movableproperties  was 12 and 6 years respectively \" from the\\ttimethe  cause  of\\taction arose \". Even  before  this  Act\\t waspassed,\\t in  a\\tcase (1) decided by  the  Supreme  Court  ofCalcutta, Peel, C. J. made the following observation:\" It has been invariably considered for many years that\\t thewidow  fully represented the estate, and it is also  settledlaw  that  adverse possession which bars her bars  the\\theirafter  her, which would not be the case if she were  a\\tmeretenant for life, as known to the English law \".In  1863 the case of Katama Natchier v. Rajah of  Shivagunga(2)  was  decided  by the Judicial Committee  of  the  PrivyCouncil\\t and  the proposition was laid down, which  has\\t notbeen  questioned  since then, that, \" when the estate  of  adeceased Hindu has vested in a female heir, a decree  fairlyand properly obtained(1)Goluckmani  v. Digambar, (1852) Macpherson  on  Mortgage,2nd ed., 20.', '2': '(1883) 9 Cal. 934.', 'i': 'Vide in this connection Jugal Kishore v. Jotendro.\\t 11`I.A. 66. 73.', '3': '(1925) 52 I.A. 322.\\t (4) (1929) 56 I.A. 267.\\nunjust\\tif they are to lose their rights simply because\\t thewidow  has  suffered  the property to be  destroyed  by\\t theadverse possession of a stranger.  The contention raised  byMr. Ghose as regards the general\\' principle to be applied insuch cases cannot, therefore, be regarded as sound.Coming\\tnow to the specific points raised in the  case,\\t thefirst  thing  that requires consideration  is,\\twhether\\t thepresent\\t suit is governed by article 124 or article  141  ofthe  Limitation Act ? The learned Judges of the\\t High  Courthave held and quite properly that the benefit of article 141could be claimed only if there was a qualified estate in thefemale heir after whose death the plaintiff was entitled  tothe property as the heir of the last male holder.  Accordingto  the\\t learned  Judges, however, this\\t condition  was\\t notfulfilled  in  the  present case, inasmuch  as\\tthe  subjectmatter\\tof  dispute  was the right of  shebaitship  and\\t therights\\tof a female shebait, it is said, are not in any\\t waymore  restricted or qualified than those of a male  shebait,although  she cannot transmit this office to her own  heirs.Reliance ha,; been placed in this connection upon a decisionof  the Madras High Court in  Pydigantan v. Rama  Dass\\t(1),which was followed by a Division Bench of the Calcutta\\tHighCourt  in  Lilabati v. Bishen(2).  This method\\tof  approachseems  to  us to be open to doubt.  Whatever might  be\\tsaidabout  the office of a trustee, which carries no  beneficialinterest  with\\tit, a shebaitship, as is now  well  settled,combines in it both the elements of office and property.  Asthe  shebaiti interest is heritable and follows the line  ofinheritance  from the founder\\' obviously when the heir is  afemale,\\t she  must  be deemed to have,\\twhat  is  known,  aswidow\\'s\\t estate in the shebaiti interest.  Ordinarily  thereare  two  limitations upon a widow\\'s estate.  In  the  firstplace,\\ther rights of alienation are restricted and  in\\t thesecond\\tplace, after her death the property goes not to\\t herheirs  but  to\\tthe heirs of the last  male  owner.   It  isadmitted that the second element is present in the(1) (I905) 28 Mad. 197.\\t      (2) (1907) 6 nC.L.J. 621.\\ncase  of succession to the rights of a female  shebait.\\t  Asregards\\t the  first,  it is quite true\\tthat  regarding\\t thepowers of alienation, a female shebait is restricted in\\t thesame  manner as the male shebait, but that is because  thereare  certain  limitations and restrictions attached  to\\t andinherent   in\\tthe  shebaiti  right  itself   which   existirrespective of the fact whether the shebaitship vests in  amale or a female heir (1).\\nBut  although we may not approve of this line  of  reasoningadopted\\t by  the High Court, we are in\\tagreement  with\\t thelearned Judges that the proper article to be applied in thiscase is article 124 and not article 141.  There could be  nodoubt  that there is an element in the shebaiti right  whichhas the legal characteristics of property ; but\\t shebaitshipis property of a peculiar and anomalous character, and it isdifficult  to  say  that  it comes  under  the\\tcategory  ofimmovable  property  as\\t it is known in\\t law.\\tArticle\\t 141refers\\texpressly to immovable property and not to  propertyin  the general sense of the word. on the other hand, it  isquite  settled that a shebaiti right is a hereditary  officeand as such comes within the express language of article 124of  the\\t Limitation  Act.  We think that  when\\tthere  is  aspecific article in the Limitation Act which covers a parti-cular  case, it is not proper to apply another article,\\t theapplication  of\\t which\\tis not free from  doubt.   We  hold,therefore,  that  article 124 is the proper  article  to  beapplied,  and  the  question now arises as  to\\twhether\\t theplaintiffs\\' suit is barred by limitation under this article,as has been held by the learned Judges of the High Court ?Article 124 relates to a suit for possession of a hereditaryoffice\\tand  the period of \\'limitation prescribed  for\\tsuchsuit  is  12 years from the date when  the  defendant  takespossession  of\\tthe office adversely to the  plaintiff.\\t Theintention   of\\tthe  legislature  is  obviously\\t  to   treathereditary office like land for the purpose of\\tbarringsuitsfor possession of such office and extinguishing the right tothe possession thereof(1)  Vide Angurbala v. Debabrata, [1951] S.C.R. 1125, 1136.\\nafter  a  certain  period.  The question is,  when  did\\t thedefendant  or her predecessor take possession of the  officeof shebait adversely to the plaintiffs?\\t It is conceded thatthe  possession\\t was adverse to Rajlakshmi,  the  holder  ofshebaiti at that time ; but the contention of Mr. Chatterjeeis  that  as the plaintiffs did not claim  through  or\\tfromRajlakshmi,  the defendant could not be regarded  as  takingpossession  of the office adversely-to the  plaintiffs.\\t  Herefers in this connection to the definition of \"Plaintiff  \"in  section 2 (8) of the Limitation Act, where it is  statedthat  plaintiff includes any person from or through  whom  aplaintiff  derives his right to sue.  In answer to this,  itis  argued  by\\tMr.  Ghose that a  shebait  like  a  trusteerepresents  the\\t entire trust estate and the  next  trustee,even  though he may not strictly claim through or  from\\t the\\n-previous  holder of the office, must be deemed to be  boundby  acts or omissions of the latter; and in support of\\tthiscontention  he\\trelies\\tupon the judgment  of  the  JudicialCommittee  in  Gnanasambanda v. Velu (1). -We do  not  thinkthat  this  contention is right.  Article 124 relates  to  ahereditary  office and this means that the office goes\\tfromone  person  to another solely by the reason of\\t the  latterbeing,\\ta  heir\\t to  the former.  Under\\t the  Hindu  Law  ofInheritance, when a female heir intervenes, she holds duringher lifetime a limited interest in the estate and after\\t herdeath succession opens out not to her heirs but to the heirsof  the\\t last male holder.  \"It has not been and  cannot  bedisputed  that\\tthe  same  rule\\t applies  in  the  case\\t  ofsuccession  to\\tshebaitship.   Reading article\\t124  of\\t theLimitation  Act along with section 2 (8), the conclusion  isirresistible that to defeat the title of the plaintiff underarticle 124 it is necessary to establish that the  defendanthad  taken  possession\\tof  the\\t office\\t adversely  to\\t theplaintiff  or  somebody from or through whom  the  plaintiffderives\\t his  title,  more  than  12  years  prior  to\\t theinstitution of the suit.  This is exactly what is laid\\tdownin Gnanasambanda v. Velu(1).  In(1)  (1900) 27 I. A. 69.\\nthis  case  two persons, who were hereditary trustees  of  areligious  endowment,  sold their right\\t of  management\\t andtransferred  the  entire endowed property to  the  defendantappellant.  The sales. were null and void and the possessiontaken  by the purchaser was adverse to the vendors from\\t thevery beginning.\\t The plaintiff Velu was the son and heir  ofone  of the hereditary trustees and he instituted  the\\tsuitmore than 12 years after the date of the transaction  claim-ing  possession\\t of the office along with the  heir  of\\t theother trustee who was joined as a defendant in the suit.  Itwas held by the Judicial Committee that the plaintiff\\'s suitwas barred and the reason given is that \"the respondent Velucould  only be entitled as heir to his father Nataraja,\\t andfrom  him  and through him, and consequently  his  suit\\t wasbarred\\tby  article 114,\" This portion of the  judgment,  itseems, was overlooked by the learned Judges of the  CalcuttaHigh  Court  and also by the Madras High Court in  the\\tcasereferred to above.  The fact that under the ordinary law  ofinheritance  the plaintiffs would come as the heirs  of\\t thehusband\\t of  Rajlakshmi is immaterial.\\tThat  would  not  bederiving their right to sue through and from the widow,\\t andin this view of the case the plaintiffs\\' suit cannot be heldto  be barred.\\tThe result, therefore, is that we allow\\t theappeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High  Courtand  restore  those  of the trial judge with  costs  to\\t theappellants in all courts.\\nAppeal allowed.'}", "blockQuotes": []}], "equivalentCitations": ["1953 AIR  125", "1953 SCR  503"], "date": {"day": "16", "month": "1", "year": "1953"}, "titlePetitioners": "Kalipada Chakraborti And Another", "titleRespondants": "Palani Bala Devi And Others", "id": "SC000693"}

Then the appellants and their men made  holesin the roof with spades, ignited inflammable materials, suchas  dry twigs, and threw them inside the kotha\\tthrough\\t theholes and set fire to the building.  Both Gurbaksh Singh andMst.   Bholan  were  caught inside and burnt  to  death.   Abrother\\t of Gurbaksh Singh called Dev, who had been at\\tthattime away, was, according to the prosecution, seized when hesubsequently turned up, thrown into the flames and was\\talsoburnt  to  death.   Meantime one Gurnam Singh,\\tP.W.  13,  acousin of Gurbaksh Singh and his neighbour, managed to\\tslipout of the village and reported the occurrence at the policestation at Nihal Singhwala,906a place eight miles away (vide Exhibit PQ).  It was then 10-30  p.m.  On receipt of this information,  the\\tpolice\\tsub-inspector,  P.W.  25, went to the village with\\ta  posse  ofconstables  and\\t with Gurnam\\' Singh.  He  found\\t the  ,housemostly burnt and recovered therefrom the charred remains  ofthree  dead  bodies  and they were identified  as  those  ofGurbaksh, Dev and Mst.\\tBholan.\\t The appellant Karnail Singhwas  actually seen at that place and arrested on  the  spot.Malkiat Singh who had been mentioned in Exhibit PQ as one ofthe participants was found in his house with gunshot  woundsand was also arrested.\\tEventually eight persons,  includingthe appellants, were charged under section 148, Indian PenalCode,  for forming an unlawful assembly with the  object  ofburning\\t the house of Gurbaksh Singh and murdering him,\\t Devand  Mat.  Bholan, and under section 302 read  with  section149  for  their\\t murder.   The\\tAdditional  Sessions  Judge,Ferozepore,  held  that the case had  not  been\\t establishedbeyond\\t doubt\\tas  against  two  of  the  accused  and\\t  heaccordingly  acquitted\\tthem.  He convicted the\\t six  othersincluding  the appellants under section 148 and section\\t 302read  with  section  149 and sentenced them  to\\t death.\\t  Onappeal,\\t the  learned Judges of the Punjab High\\t Court\\theldthat  \"although\\t there\\tcan be no doubt\\t whatever  that\\t theoccurrence took place more or less on the lines described bythe  prosecution  witnesses, and the primary object  of\\t theculprits must have been to murder Gurbaksh Singh,  deceased,in consequence of the bitter enmity between him and the mainbody of the accused\" and that \"although it may very well  betrue  that  all\\t the  six  appellants  took  part  in\\tthisoccurrence \"  , the evidence against the four  accused otherthan  the  appellants  was  insufficient  to  sustain  theirconviction, as it consisted of the testimony of persons\\t whowere  at  a  distance of 40 to 50 feet\\tfrom  the  scene  ofoccurrence  and\\t who  claimed  to  identify  the  particularaccused\\t  only\\tby  their  voice.   They  were\\t accordinglyacquitted.   Then  dealing  with the case  against  the\\t twoappellants  they  observed that as against them,  there\\t wasevidence  of the two eyewitness Gurnam Singh (P.W.  13)\\t andMaghar Singh907(P.W.  14),  that Maghar Singh was not a  reliable  witness,that  nothing could be urged against the evidence of  GurnamSingh, that even so it would be Unsafe to base a  convictionon  his\\t evidence alone, but that the  presence\\t of  KarnailSingh at the spot and the existence of wounds on the  personof  Malkiat Singh afforded sufficient corroboration  of\\t theevidence  of Gurnam Singh.  They accordingly  confirmed\\t theconviction and sentence as against the appellants.  As\\tfourof the accused were acquitted in appeal, the learned  Judgesset aside the conviction of the appellants under section 149and substituted section 34, Indian Penal Code, there for.Two contentions have been urged on behalf of the appellants,that  the  evidence which bad been accepted by\\tthe  learnedJudges\\tas reliable was insufficient to establish the  guiltof,  the appellants and that their conviction under  section34  was bad as no charge had been framed against them  underthat  section.\\t On  the first point, the  argument  of\\t thelearned counsel for the appellants was that having held thatthe  only eye witness whose evidence was worthy of  credencewas  P.W. 13, and that even his evidence could not be  actedupon unless it was corroborated, the learned Judges were  inerror  in holding that there was such corroboration  againstthe  appellants.   The circumstance relied on by  the  courtbelow as corroborating the evidence of P.W. 13 was that\\t theappellants were proved to have been present at the scene  ofoccurrence  and there was no satisfactory  explanation\\tfromthem  there for.  As regards Karnail Singh, the police\\tsub-inspector,  P.W. 25, actually found him emerging out of\\t theburning house with a spear in his hand.\\t He had injuries  onhis person and his pyjama was bloodstained.  He was arrestedon  the \\'spot and the spear and the pyjama were\\t seized\\t andmarked as Exhibits P-12 and P-20.  As for Malkiat Singh, hisname was mentioned in the first information report,  ExhibitPQ, and P.W. 25 went to his house and found him with gunshotwounds and arrested him.  In the statement given by  KarnailSingh under section 342, Criminal Procedure Code, he  statedthat when he saw the house908of   Gurnam Singh on fire, he went there and was,  assaultedby culprits, that Malkiat Singh came there to help him, thatwhen  they were grappling with the culprits he was  attackedand  Malkiat, Singh received a gunshot and  thereafter\\ttheywent  away to their houses.  The statement of Malkiat  Singhalso  was on similar lines.  There was no evidence that\\t anyother  person or persons were responsible for the  acts\\t andthe   learned  Judges  therefore  rejected  as\\tuntrue\\t theexplanation  of\\t the appellants that  \"they  received  theseinjuries  while intervening against some unknown  assailantson behalf of their bitterest enemy.\"\\nIt is contended for the appellants that the mere presence ofKarnail\\t Singh\\tat the place of occurrence would  in  itselfmean nothing and that it would amount to corroboration\\tonlyif  some further act incriminatory in character was  proved.With  reference\\t to Malkiat Singh, it was  argued  that\\t theexistence  of gunshot wounds would be inconclusive as  therewas  no evidence as to how they were caused.  It  was  \\'con-tended that, the theory of the learned Judges that  GurbakshSingh  might himself have shot at him trough the hole  whilehe  was on the roof was. wholly unsupported by evidence\\t andopposed to the medical evidence in the case as to the natureof the wounds and to the fact that no gun was recovered fromthe house, and that there was accordingly nothing to connectMalkiat\\t Singh\\twith the incident at the house\\tof  GurbakshSingh.\\t With  reference to the statements  of\\tthe  accusedadmitting  their presence at the place but  explaining\\tthatsome  culprits had set fire to the house and that they\\twentthere thereafter, it was argued that if the statements\\twereto be taken into consideration they must be taken as a wholeand  that  it  was not proper to  accept  the  incriminatingportion, and reject the exculpatory portion thereof and\\t theobservations  of this court in Hanumant v. State  Of  MadhyaPradesh(1),  at page 1111 were relied on in support of\\tthisposition.   The result according to the appellants  is\\tthatthere was not sufficient(1)  [1952] S.C.R. 1091.\\ncorroboration  of the evidence of P. W. 13 to support  theirconviction.\\nIt  is necessary in view of this contention to\\texamine\\t theevidence in order to see what corroboration there is againsteach  of  the  appellants.   So\\t far  as  Karnail  Singh  isconcerned, his presence at the scene of occurrence under thecircumstances  disclosed  in the evidence is  sufficient  tocorroborate  the  evidence  of\\tP.  W.\\t13.   It  should  beremembered  that  Gumam Singh is not an approver.  He  is  awitness\\t against whom the learned Judges had nothing to\\t sayand  if they required corroboration of his evidence  it\\t wasbecause\\t he  was  a  relation of the  deceased\\tand  it\\t wasconsidered  not\\t safe  to  base a  conviction  on  his\\tsoletestimony. ,The corroboration that is required in such casesis not what would be necessary to support the evidence of anapprover but what would be sufficient to ,lend assurance  tothe  evidence  before  them,  and  satisfy  them  that\\t theparticular  persons were really concerned in the  murder  ofthe  deceased.\" (Vide Lachhman Singh v. State(1)).   KarnailSingh  was  arrested  on  the  spot  with  a  spear  and   abloodstained pyjama, and these are pieces of evidence  whichwould  support\\tthe inference that he was concerned  in\\t thecrime.\\nThe  case of Malkiat Singh presents greater difficulty.\\t  Hewas arrested in his house with gunshot wounds on his  personand  unless it could be established that they were  receivedat  the scene of occurrence that would not be sufficient  toconnect\\t him with the crime.  We agree that the\\t mention  ofhis  name  in  Exhibit PQ cannot be held  to  be  sufficientcorroboration because that is only the statement of P. W. 13at  an\\tearlier stage and it is\\t not  independent  evidence.With reference to the statement of the accused under section342,  Criminal\\tProcedure  Code, it is true that  if  it  issought\\tto  be\\tused as an admission it must be\\t read  as  awhole;\\tbut  where  it consists\\t of  distinct  and  separatematters,  there is no reason why. an admission contained  inone matter should not be relied on without reference to\\t thestatements relating to other matters.  In this case the(1)  [1952] S.C.R. 839 at P. 845.\\nadmission  of the appellant that he was present at  or\\tnearthe  scene of occurrence is distinct and separate  from\\t hisexplanation as to how he received the injuries.\\t The learnedJudges\\thaving\\tdisbelieved,  in our  opinion  rightly,\\t thestatement of the. appellant that the house was burnt by someunknown\\t enemies of Gurbaksh Singh and that it was they\\t whomurdered  him, we do not see any objection to the  statementof,  the appellant that he was present at the scene  of\\t theoccurrence  from being used as an admission.  Another  pieceof corroboration which the learned Judges relied on was thatin their view the gunshot wounds must have been received  byMalkiat\\t Singh\\tat the house of Gurbaksh Singh.\\t  They\\tgavetheir  finding\\ton  this point\\tin  the\\t alternative.\\tTheyobserved  that\\tthe  injuries  might  have  been  caused  byGurbaksh  Singh firing from inside the house.  But  of\\tthisthere  is  no evidence and the medical evidence is  in\\tfactopposed\\t to it and as already stated, no gun  was  recoveredfrom  the house of the deceased.  In the, alternative,\\ttheyobserved that the injuries might have been caused by a\\tshotfrom  one  of his own men.  This view is  supported  by\\t theevidence  of  p.W. 14 who deposed that while  the  incidentswere in progress Malkiat Singh stated that he had been\\tshotby one of his own men and then left the place.\\tIt is arguedfor the appellant that as the learned Judges had declined toact on the evidence of P. W. 14, the alternative  suggestionmust be ruled out as unsupported by evidence.  What all\\t thelearned\\t Judges\\t remarked about P. W. 14 was that it  was  \"impossible  to\\tplace  any very\\t great\\treliance  on  MagharSingh\\'s evidence.\" But then they also expressly referred  tohis evidence on this point (Vide page 61 of the record)\\t andaccepted it as one of the possible alternatives (Vide,\\tpage'}", "subPara": "{'65': 'And on their finding that the injuries must have\\tbeenreceived  at  the place of occurrence and  the\\ttheory\\tthatGurbaksh  Singh fired the shot being negatived, there is  nodifficulty in holding that they were prepared to accept\\t theevidence  of P. W. 14 on this point.  Thus there  are  amplematerials for holding that the gunshot wounds were  receivedby Malkiat Singh in the house of Gurbaksh Singh and911that  is sufficient corroboration of the evidence of  P.  W.', '13': 'In this view we must overrule the first contention.Then  the  next question is whether the\\t conviction  of\\t theappellant under section 302 read with section 34, when\\ttheyhad  been charged only, under section 302 read with  section149,  was illegal The contention of the appellants  is\\tthatthe  scope of section 149 is different from that of  section34,  that  while  what section 149 requires is\\tproof  of  acommon\\tobject,\\t it would be necessary under section  34  toestablish  a  common intention and that therefore  when\\t thecharge\\tagainst the accused is under section 149, it  cannotbe  converted  in  appeal into one under  section  34.\\t Thefollowing observations of this court in Dalip Singh v. Stateof Punjab(1) were relied on in support of this position :-\"  Nor\\tis  it possible in this case  to  have\\trecourse  tosection 34 because the appellants have not been charged withthat  even  in\\tthe alternative\\t and  the  common  intentionrequired  by  section 34 and the common object\\trequired  bysection 149 are far from being the same thing.\\t\"It is true that there is substantial difference between\\t thetwo  sections  but as observed by Lord\\tSumner\\tin  BarendraKumar Ghosh v. Emperor(1), they also to some extent  overlapand  it is a question to be determined on the facts of\\teachcase  whether  the  charge under section  149  overlaps\\t theground covered by section 34.  If the common object which isthe  subjectmatter of the charge under section 149 does\\t notnecessarily  involve  a\\t common intention,  then  the  subs-titution  of  section  34 for section 149  might  result  inprejudice  to  the  accused and ought not  therefore  to  bepermitted.   But if the facts to be proved and the  evidenceto be adduced with reference to the charge under section 149would be the same \\'if the charge were under section 34, thenthe failure to charge the accused under section 34 could notresult in any(1)  A.I.R. 1953 S.C. 364 at P. 366.', '2': '[1952] S.C.R. 839.', '1': 'A.I.R. 1953 S.C. 364.'}", "blockQuotes": []}], "equivalentCitations": ["1954 AIR  204", "1954 SCR  904"], "date": {"day": "9", "month": "1", "year": "1953"}, "titlePetitioners": "Karnail Singh And Another", "titleRespondants": "The State Of Punjab", "id": "SC000694"}

It held that Rs. 4,40,878also were received in British India956and  the company was liable in respect of that\\tamount.\\t  Inregard\\tto  the item of Rs. 6,71,735, the High\\tCourt  foundthat the facts stated by the Tribunal were not sufficient toenable\\tit to reach a decision and therefore  directed\\tthatthe Tribunal should submit a supplementary statement of casesetting\\t out  the several aspects set out in  the  judgment.The  High Court reframed the question in regard to  the\\t twoitems  of  Rs.\\t12,68,480 and Rs.  4,40,878  in\\t the  mannerfollowing:-', '1Whether': \"the sums of Rs. 12,68,480 and Rs. 4,40,878\\tweresale proceeds of the goods sold by the assessee to merchantsin British India or were debts due by the said merchants ?(2)Whether if they were sale proceeds, they were received inBritish India ?\\nand  answered them by stating that they were sale  proceedsand  they were received in British India.  There was also  athird question which was comprised in the reference and thatquestion was framed as under:-\\nWhether the profits of the assessee's business are  includedin the sums of Rs. 12,68,480 and Rs. 4,40,878 ?This  question was also answered by stating that  they\\twereincluded in these two sums.  The company obtained leave fromthe  High Court to appeal against the decision in regard  tothe  two  sums of Rs. 12,68,480 and Rs. 4,40,878  and  hencethis appeal.\\nIt  is common ground that the company is a  nonresident\\t andits  accounts  have been regularly kept\\t according  to\\tthe,mercantile system.  Its balance sheets were also prepared onthat  basis.   The company was assessed to  tax\\t in  BritishIndia  on  the\\tbasis  that these two  sums  of\\t money\\twerereceived  in British India by or on behalf of  the  company.In  regard  to the item of Rs. 12,68,480,  even\\t though\\t theamounts\\t of  the  sales bills were  in\\tthe  first  instancedebited\\t by  the  company in its books\\tto  the\\t account  ofMessrs.\\t  Jagmohandas  Ramanlal & Co. the sale\\tproceeds  inaccordance with957the  terms  of the sales bills were paid by  the  respectivemerchants to Messrs.

The receipt of these amounts thusfell within section 4 (1) (a) of the Act and the profits  orgains  of this business thus were received in British  Indiaby or on behalf of the company.\\nThe  company however sought exemption from liability to\\t taxon  the\\t grounds (a) that the accounts of the  company\\twerekept on the mercantile or book profit basis under which\\t theaccrual of profit as shown in the account was the  criterionof  taxability\\tand section 4(l) (a) had no  application  atall;  (b)  that it was obligatory on the  authorities  undersection\\t 13 of the Act to accept that system of\\t maintainingaccounts  except under the proviso to that section and\\tthatthe method of computation there was made the very basis of124958chargeability  and section 10 read with section 13  operatedto  save these amounts from chargeability and (c)  that\\t theamounts having been treated as received when credit  entrieswere made in the books of account,  and chargeability havingcrystallised  on  the date when the income  accrued  or\\t wastreated as received, there was no further scope for a chargewhen the amounts were subsequently actually received and thesubsequent  handling of the amounts by the company  and\\t thereceipt thereof in British India were of no consequence.The  mercantile\\t system of accounting or what  is  otherwiseknown  as  the double entry system is opposed. to  the\\tcashsystem\\tof  book  keeping under which a record\\tis  kept  ofactual cash receipts and actual cash payments, entries beingmade  only  when money is actually collected  or  disbursed.That  system brings into credit what is due, immediately  itbecomes\\t legally due and before it is actually received\\t andit  brings  into debit expenditure the amount  for  which  alegal  liability  has been incurred before  it\\tis  actuallydisbursed.   The profits or gains of the business which\\t arethus  credited are not realised but having been\\t earned\\t aretreated\\t as  received though in fact there is  nothing\\tmorethan  an  accrual or arising of the profits at\\tthat  stage.They  are book profits.\\t Receipt being not the sole test  ofchargeability  and  profits and gains that have\\t accrued  orarisen\\tor are deemed to have accrued or arisen\\t being\\talsoliable\\tto be charged for income-tax, the  assessability  ofthese  profits\\twhich  are thus credited  in  the  books  ofaccount\\t arises not because they are received  but  because.they have accrued or arisen.\", 'Mr': 'Kolah pressed into service the argument based on section13  of\\tthe  Act that the mercantile  system  of  accountingregularly  adopted  by the assessee was\\t obligatory  on\\t theincome-tax authorities for computation of his income.  Whileagreeing   generally  with  that  submission  in   case\\t  ofresidents, we doubt whether that position would be availableto  a  non-resident,  who maintains  his  books\\t of  accountoutside\\t British India according to the\\t mercantile  system.The  section would only be relevant where the total  profitsof the assessee have to be computed, in which event he wouldbe entitled to claim that they should be computed  accordingto  the\\t system\\t of accounts maintained\\t by  him.   But\\t thesection would hardly be relevant where stray items of incomeare  caught  in taxable territories as received\\t in  taxableterritories  by a nonresident.\\tThe entries in\\tthe  presentcase were put in merely to prove that the sale proceeds werereceived outside British India where the entries were  made.That contention however could not be sustained, as section 4(1)  (a) is concerned with cases of actual receipt  and\\t notwith cases of paper receipts.\\nHaving regard to the observations made above we have come tothe  conclusion\\t that the High Court \",as right\\t in  holdingthat the two sums of Rs. 12,68,480 and Rs. 4,40,878 were thesale  proceeds\\tof  the\\t goods sold  and  delivered  by\\t theappellant  to  merchants in British India,  that  they\\twerereceived by Messrs,964Jagmohandas  Ramanlal  & Co. and by the\\t banks\\tand  shroffsthrough whom the railway receipts were negotiated, on behalfof  the appellant in.  British India, that they were  liableto  tax under section 4 (1) (a) of the ,*Act as having\\tbeenreceived  in  British  India on its behalf,  that  there  isnothing either in the facts and circumstances of the case orin law why they should be exempted from such liability, thatthe  answers  given to the questions which  were  ultimatelyconsidered by the High Court were correct, and the appellantwas  rightly  held liable for the tax on these\\ttwo  amountssubject to all just deductions and allowances. - The  appealtherefore fails and must stand dismissed with costs.BOSE, J.-I respectfully disagree.\\nSection\\t 3 of the Indian Income-tax Act provides that the  \"total  income  \"  is to be charged in  accordance  with\\t theprovisions  of\\tthe Act.  We have therefore to\\tsee  what  \"total income \" means.\\n\" Total income \" is defined in section 2(15).  It means (not\" includes \" but means) the total amount of income,  profitsand  gains  \"referred  to in sub-section (1)  of  section  4computed  in the manner, laid down in this Act.\"  Therefore,the  computation of all income refeffed to in section  4(l.)has to be \"in the manner laid down in the Act \".Section\\t 4  (apart  from the provisos  and  explanations  isdivided\\t into three clauses, (a), (b) and  (c).\\t      Clause', '2[1934]': '2 I.T.R. 369.', '3': '[1939] 66 I.A. 23.\\n&  Co. or by the various banks or shroffs in  British  Indiathrough\\t whom  the railway receipts  were  negotiated.\\t Thefirst  receipt\\tof the moneys was therefore when  they\\twerepaid  as  such\\tby. the merchants  to  Messrs.\\t JagmohandasRamanlal & Co. or to the various banks or shroffs as  above.Whatever paid by the merchants to these several parties werethe  sale  proceeds  of the goods which had  been  sold\\t anddelivered  by  the company to them and\\tthey  were  receivedwithin the meaning of section 4 (1) (a) of the Act by  theseseveral parties on behalf of the company in British India atthe  time when these payments were made by the merchants  tothem.', 'a': 'has nothing to do with this basis of taxation.   Section13 which is an integral part of the computation of the totalincome\\tof the assessee and is compulsory on the  income-taxauthorities  as well when computing the total  income  (videsection\\t 2  (15)  ) does not lay  down\\tany  exemption\\tfromliability.   It\\t only sets up a mode of computation  of\\t theincome\\twhich is liable to assessment and imposes  upon\\t theincome-tax  authorities an obligation to accept the mode  ofaccounting  regularly adopted by the assessee except in\\t thecases\\twhere  the  proviso  to\\t that  section\\tcomes\\tintooperation.  The profits earned and credited in the books  ofaccount\\t being thus taken as the basis of  computation,\\t thesystem of accounting postulates the existence of debts in sofar as moneys re ain due and payable by the parties to\\twhomthey  have been debited and when it is realised\\t that  thesedebts are not recoverable the assessee gets a deduction\\t forthe bad debts under section 10 (2) (xi).  This however\\tdoesnot mean that the transaction as it has been recorded in thebooks  of account under the mercantile system of  accountingor   the  double  entry\\t system\\t is  metamorphosed  or\\t therelationship   between\\tthe  parties  assumes  a   differentcharacter.  What was in its inception a transaction of\\tsaleand  purchase is not converted into another  transaction  asbetween\\t creditor and debtor.  The relationship\\t as  betweenvendor and purchaser still subsists and there does not\\tcomeinto  existence a new relationship as between  creditor\\t anddebtor with all its necessary consequences.  The transactionas  it has been recorded in the books of account has got  tobe  worked  out to its fullest extent.\\tMerely\\tbecause\\t thegoods have been supplied and the price thereof has been\\t de-bited  to  the purchaser the rights and obligations  of\\t thevendor\\tand  purchaser\\tinter  se  are\\tnot  in\\t any  manneraffected.  The vendor is bound to fulfil all his obligationsunder  the contract and continues to be liable for  all\\t theconsequences of his default including rejection of his goodsby the purchaser or a claim for damages961for  breach  of warranty by him.  The purchaser\\t is  equallyentitled  to reject the goods or to claim the damages as  onbreach\\tof warranty by the vendor and all these\\t rights\\t andobligations  have got to be worked out in spite of the\\tfactthat  the entries \\'are made in the books of account  by\\t thevendor\\t in  accordance\\t with  the  mercantile\\t system\\t  ofaccounting adopted by him.  The vendor could not say that heis under no further obligation to the purchaser and that thepurchaser must pay the price of the goods debited to him  asa  debt\\t arising out of the book entry.\\t The  count  in\\t anyaction filed by the vendor against the purchaser would be  acount  for the price of goods sold and delivered  and  wouldnot be a count on an assumpsit for recovery of a debt due bythe debtor to him.\\nIt  is\\tclear  that under these circumstances  there  is  noreceipt of the moneys at all, either actual or constructive,in  cash or in kind, by actual payment or by  adjustment  orsettlement  of\\taccounts.  There is also no  scope  for\\t theargument  that even though these sums may not be said to  beeither\\tactually or constructively received they  should  be\"deemed\\t to  be\\t received\".  The expression  \"deemed  to  bereceived\" only means deemed by the provisions of the Act  tobe  received.\\tThe phrase statutory receipt might  be\\tcon-veniently  employed to cover income which is \\'deemed  to  bereceived\\' and instances of such statutory receipts are to befound  in the provisions of the Act, e.g., section  18\\t(4),section\\t 58 (E), section 58 (J) (3), section  7(2),  section16(1)  (c)  and sections 19 (2) (vii) and  16(2).  (See\\t theobservations  of Beaumont C.J. in Commissionei,\\t of  Income-tax,  Bombay v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd.(1).  An  amountcannot be \"deemed to be received\" merely by the volition  orsweet will of an individual.  In all the cases which we havementioned  above the profits earned which were\\tcredited  inthe  books of account according to the mercantile system  ofaccounting  were at best \"treated as having  been  received\"which is neither \"received\" nor \"deemed to be received\"\\t andtherefore not within the purview of section 4 (1) (a).(1) [1938] 6 I.T.R. 603 at p. 614.\\nIf then profits which have been thus credited cannot be saidto  be\\treceived nor deemed to have been received  when\\t theentries\\t were made in the books of account,  the  contentionurged  before  us by Mr. Kolah that  there could  not  be  asecond\\treceipt\\t of  the amount in British  India  does\\t notsurvive.  It is true that the words used in section 4(l) (a)relate to the first receipt after the accrual of the income.Once it is received by the party entitled to it, in  respectof any subsequent dealing with the said amount it cannot  besaid  to  be \" received\" as income on  that  occasion.\\t[PerKania  J.  in B. M. Kamdar (1)].  The  \"receipt\"  of  incomerefers\\tto  the first occasion when the recipient  gets\\t themoney under his own control.  Once an amount is received  asincome,\\t any  remittance or transmission of  the  amount  toanother\\t place\\tdoes  not result in  \"receipt\",\\t within\\t themeaning\\t of  this  clause, at the  other  place.   This\\t wasdefinitely established by the Privy; Council in\\t PondicherryRailway\\t  Co.  v.  Commissioner\\t of  IncomeTax\\t2)  and\\t  inCommissionei, of Income-tax v. Mathias (3).  If,  therefore,the income, profits or gains have been once received by\\t theassessee  even\\tthough\\toutside British India  they  do\\t notbecome\\tchargeable  by\\treason of  the\\tmoneys\\thaving\\tbeenbrought in British India, because what is chargeable is\\t thefirst receipt of the moneys and not a subsequent dealing  bythe  assessee with the said amount.  In that event they\\t arebrought,  by  the assessee as his own moneys  which  he\\t hasalready\\t received  and had control over and  they  cease  toenjoy the character of income, profits or gains.This  ratio  however  does not apply to\\t the  facts  of\\t thepresent case before us.\\t The moneys were neither received bythe company nor could be deemed to have been received by  itwhen  the  entries  were made in the  books  of\\t account  atPetlad.\\t They had merely accrued or arisen to it and so\\t faras the receipt thereof is concerned they were first receivedin  British  India  when  they\\twere  received\\tby   Messrs.Jagmohandas Ramanlal(1)[1946] 14 I.T.R. 14 at P. 39,(2)[1931] 58  I.A. 239.', 'b': 'deals with residents and (c) with nonresidents.  As (a)is  general,  it is legitimate to infer that  it  refers  toboth.\\tTherefore, the words \" received\" and \" deemed to  bereceived \" must be construed in the same sense in both casesexcept of course where it is otherwise provided in the\\tAct,for sub-section (1) is made subject to the provisions of theAct.\\nNow  the words \"deemed to be received\" can be excluded\\tfromconsideration  at  once\\t because  I  agree  that  they\\t areconfined, and are intended to be confined to what I may callthe  deeming sections in the Act, that is to say,  to  caseswhere the deeming must be done965under  the  express provisions of the Act.  That  leaves  uswith the word \"received\" (I am of course only deal ing\\twithsection\\t 4(l) (a) which deals with \" receipts\\' and not\\twithsection\\t 4(l) (c) which refers to \"accruals\"  and  \"arisals\"and to that which is deemed to \"accrue\" or \"arise\").Now this, in my opinion, is to be contrasted with the  words\"accrue\" and \"arise\" which are used in clauses (b) and\\t(c).Though\\tthere  may be overlapping in some cases,  I  do\\t notthink  the three are intended to mean the same\\tthing.\\t ThePrivy  Council\\tthought\\t in Commissioner  of  Income-tax  v.Mathias(1)  that there is some variation in meaning  betweenthem  and  in  Commissioner of\\tIncome-tax  v.\\tChunilal  B.Mehta(2)  they\\tdrew  attention to  the\\t antithesis  between\"accruing  and\\tarising in\" and \"received in\",\\tthough\\ttheyalso  said in the earlier case that there is not a  completedisjunction  between  them  and\\t that  they  are  not  threemutually  exclusive qualifications (page 56); that is,\\tthatthere may be some overlapping in certain cases.Next, we turn to section 6 which divides the various sourcesof   income  under  various  heads  for\\t the   purposes\\t  ofcomputation  and  chargeability and states  that  each\\theadshall\\tbe   \"\\tchargeable\"  \"in  the\\tmanner\\t hereinafterappearing\".  It is to be observed that the word \"shall\"\\t hasbeen used and not \" may \" thereby implying that there is  nooption in the matter.  So far as business is concerned,\\t thehead is No. (iv) \"Profits and gains of business etc.\"That carries us on to sections 10 and 13 which prescribe themethod\\t of  computation.   Here  again,  the  language\\t  isimperative  and\\t in  the case of a business  the  method  ofcomputation  has  to  be in accordance with  the  method  ofaccounting   regularly\\t employed  by  the   assessee:\\t seeCommissioner of Income-tax v. Kameshwar Singh(3).Now  in the present case, the method of accounting  was\\t themercantile system.  The essential difference(1) [1939] 7 I.T.R. 48 at 56.  (3) [1933] 1 I.T.R. 94 at 100and 101.', '2': '[1938] P I.T.R. 521 at 527,125966between this and the cash basis system is that in the latteractual\\treceipts and disbursements are taken  into  account.In  the\\t former,  sums which are due  to  the  business\\t areentered on the credit side immediately they are legally\\t dueand  before they are actually received and expenditures\\t areentered\\t the  moment  a legal liability to  pay\\t arises\\t andbefore the actual disbursements.  The profit or loss at\\t theend  of\\t the accounting year is therefore based,  not  on  adifference  between what was actually received and what\\t wasactually  paid out, but on the difference between the  rightto  receive and the liability to pay.  I find it  impossiblein  such a case to say that the taxation -is on\\t income,  orprofits and gains which were \"received\".  It can only be oilprofits which \" accrued \" or \"arose\" to the assessee in\\t theaccounting  year:  see the Privy Council in  Feroz  Shah  v.Commissioner   of  Income-tax(\\').   That,  in  my   opinion,excludes  section  4(l) (a) and that in turn means  that  insuch a case a resident is taxed under section 4(l) (b) and anon-resident under section 4(l) (c).\\nNow,  this to my mind is of vital importance.\\tThe  primaryobject\\tof  the Income-tax Act is to tax and not  merely  toascertain  an  income.\\t The computation of  the  income  issubsidiary and is only for the purposes of ascertaining\\t thequantum\\t of  the  tax: see  Commissioner  of  Income-tax  v.Kameshwar  Singh(2).  Therefore, if the legislature  choosesto  lay down different methods of computation and  say\\tthatthe  taxation  shall  be on the amount so  computed,  it  isessential  that these methods be adhered to.  In some  casesthis  may be to the advantage of the assessee and in  othersit may operate to his disadvantage.  But that is immaterial.The  importance\\t lies in this.\\tAll that can be taxed  in  agiven  year are the profits and gains which are received  orwhich  arise or accrue in the \" previous year\", and  if\\t theAct  directs that the profits are to be computed in a  givencase  on \"accruals\" or \"arisals\" and not on actual  receiptsit is essential that that be(1)  [1933] 1 I.T.R. 219at 224 and 225. (2) [1933] 1  I.T.R.94 at 100.\\ndone;  and it follows from that that the tax in such a\\tcasecan only be on the accruals or arisals and not on the actualreceipts,  for clearly you cannot tax on that which you\\t areforbidden  to  compute in a case where the tax can  only  belevied on what is computable. under the Act.It  is\\timportant to draw the distinction for  this  reason.The  rate of tax varies from year to year, therefore if\\t thebook profits which are directed to be taxed in a given\\tyearare,  say, Rs. 10,000 and the actual receipts only Rs.\\t100,it makes a lot of difference which figure is taken; nor doesit  even  itself  out in the long run, for if  the  rate  oftaxation  increases in the following year and the  state  ofthe  business  is  just the reverse, namely  that  the\\tbookprofits are only Rs. 100 whereas the actual receipts arisingfrom  the  previous year\\'s transactions are Rs.\\t 10,000,  itwill  make a considerable difference to the assessee in\\t theaggregate of tax payable over the years, whether he pays oilthe  basis  of book profits or actual receipts\\tin  the\\t twoyears.\\nI am not able to draw a distinction between a resident and anon-resident  in  these matters.  I can find no\\t ground\\t forholding that in the case of a resident the mercantile systemmust  be  adopted for computing the profits if that  is\\t thesystem\\tof accounting regularly employed but that that\\tneednot be done in the case of a non-resident.  If the  assesseehad  been  a  resident company, the taxation  would,  in  myopinion,  have\\tbeen under section 4(l) (b) on\\tprofits\\t andgains  which had accrued or arisen and not under  section  4(1)  (a)  on  profits which had\\t been  received.   The\\tsameprinciple  must, in my opinion, be applied in the case of  anonresident  and therefore section 4 (1) (c)  is  attracted,provided  the  profits and gains have  actually\\t accrued  orarisen\\tin the taxable territories or they can,\\t because  ofsection\\t 42, be deemed to have accrued or arisen there.\\t  Ifsection\\t 4 (1) (c) is not attracted, then the tax cannot  belevied.\\nNow,  applying section 4 (1) (c), the question is  where  dothe profits and gains arise or accrue, in a case968like  the  present ? This is not free  from  difficulty\\t andvarious\\t views have been, and can be, taken.  But  as  theseexpressions have not been defined and as they are not  wordsof art, I think they should be construed  in their  ordinarymeaning\\t which\\tbusinessmen  would  ordinarily\\tand   easilyunderstand  in a business transaction.\\tWhen goods are\\tsoldit is to my  mind evident that the profit or the loss on anyparticular  transaction\\t arises out of the sale,  for  untilthere is a sale there can be no profit. - The profit may notbe  wholly  attributable  to the sale but  that\\t is  anothermatter.\\t It is to my mind unquestionable that they arise, inpart, at any rate, out of the sale.  Therefore, if the goodsare  sold in the taxable territories, then, to my mind,\\t theprofits,  or a portion of them, arise there.  As  the  PrivyCouncil\\t pointed  out  in  Commissioner\\t of  Income-tax\\t  v.Chunilal B. Mehta(1), in determining where the profits arisethe  place of the formation of the contract is not the\\tsolecriterion, other matters, as for example acts done under thecontract are also material.\\nI  am not here attempting to go behind the decision  of\\t theSupreme\\t Court to the effect that the place of sale  is\\t notnecessarily  the place of the receipt of the profits.  I  amconstruing the word \"arise \" and not \"receive\".That brings me to the next question, where were the goods inthe  present ease sold ? That is a, mixed question  of\\tfactand law and must vary in each case and must, in my  opinion,be answered in a commonsense way and not necessarily in\\t theartificial  manner  laid down by the Sale of  Goods  Act  todetermine where and when the property passes.  What are\\t thefacts here ? In the case of the Rs. 4 lakhs odd, the controlover  the corpus of the goods was retained by  the  assesseeright up to the moment the price was paid; and the price waspaid  not outside British India but to his nominees in\\tthiscountry,  namely, to the assessee\\'s banks in British  India.These  banks  retained the documents of title  and  had\\t theright to refuse(1)  [1938]61.T.R.521 at533.\\ndelivery   until  the  money  was  actually   handed   over.Therefore,  the right to get possession of the goods and  totake  delivery accrued or arose in British India  where\\t themoney  was actually paid, and that to my mind must be  takento  be\\tthe place where the profits accrued  and  arose\\t forincome-tax  purposes,  not because the\\tmoney  was  receivedthere,\\tfor we are not concerned with actual  receipts,\\t butbecause\\t the  right  which  accrued  at\\t the  date  of\\t thetransaction  was to receive the money in British  India\\t andhand over the goods there on the receipt of the money.\\tAs Ihave  said, the substance of the transaction must be  viewedand  that cannot be made to depend upon the method of  book-keeping.   Even if there are no books the profits on such  atransaction would accrue in the place where the money is  tobe  paid and the goods are to be handed over.  I cannot\\t seehow  that  can alter by reason of the method  of  accountingemployed.    Accordingly,  I  agree  that  the\\t method\\t  ofaccounting  adopted  by\\t the  assessee\\tcannot\\taffect\\t thesubstance of the transactions between the parties or  affecttheir  nature.\\t The rights and liabilities of\\tthe  partiesinter se cannot be made to depend on the way in which one ofthem  chooses to keep its books.  But that is not  the\\tcasewhen  we  come to the question of  taxation  for  income-taxpurposes.   There  the method of accounting is\\tvital.\\t Buteven there the substance of the transaction must be  viewed,for  the  substance  cannot  alter  by\\ta  mere\\t method\\t  ofaccounting.   It  is evident that if the assessee  had\\tbeenresident  in British India and these transactions  had\\tbeenomitted\\t from tile books, the sums which ought to have\\tbeenentered\\t would\\tbe  taxable  as\\t items\\twhich  had   escapedassessment even if there had been no actual receipts in thator in any following year.  Therefore, it is not the entry inthe books which attracts the taxation but the profits on thetransaction  itself, and when the mercantile system is\\tusedthe profits arise when the right to receive them accrues andnot  when  the\\tentry is made.\\tIf the\\tsystem\\tis  properlyemployed  the entry is made as soon as the right to  receivethe price arises and so for all practical970purposes that is the date ordinarily referred to, but a\\t mancannot manipulate the amount of his tax by choosing to enteror  not\\t to  enter  items which ought to  be  entered  on  aparticular date, as and when he\\t pleases.\\nNow, the Rs. 4 lakhs odd represent actual receipts but\\tthatis not what is taxable -when the computation is based on themercantile  system.  What should be taxed, or  rather  takeninto  account for the purposes of taxation, are the  figuresentered\\t in  the accounting year as the sale  price  of\\t thevarious\\t transactions which the Rs. 4 lakhs represent.\\t Theprofits which arise out of these transactions do not, on  myview, escape tax because the profits accrue or arise in\\t thetaxable territories.  But the figure on which the tax is  tobe  computed  is  not the 4 lakhs odd  which  represent\\t theactual\\treceipts but another figure which  unfortunately  wehave  not  been\\t given.\\t I am of course\\t assuming  that\\t thefigures were duly entered in the books at the proper time inaccordance  with  the mercantile system of  accounting.\\t  Ifthey were not, then the Income-tax authorities have power totax  income  which, for one reason or another,\\thas  escapedassessmentTurning\\t to  the  Rs. 12 lakhs.\\t We  know  that\\t the  figureentered in the books relating to these transactions was\\t Rs.13,41,744.  i am not clear whether that was entered  in\\t theaccounting  year  with\\twhich we  are  concerned,  though  Igathered that that was the case.  The actual receipts, whichfollowed  later,  amounted  to only Rs.\\t 12,68,480.   In  myopinion, if anything is computable for the purposes of\\ttax,it is the former figure (assuming all the entries are in theaccounting  year)  and\\tnot the latter.\\t  But  in  order  todetermine  whether  the profits on  these  transactions\\t aretaxable at all, we must examine the transactions.In  these  cases  the sales were to  merchants\\tresident  inAhmedabad.  But according to the assessee\\'s affidavit,\"  In respect of buyers from Ahmedabad, the apllicant  Millshave no account of such buyers.\\t The971price  is  debited to the account of  the  said\\t JagmohandasRamlal and company and credited to the sales account in\\t thebooks of the applicant:\"\\nand later, Jagmohandas\" discharges its debts by making payments to the  applicantsfrom time to time towards the balance in their said  accountin  the books of the applicant Mills.  The said amounts\\t arepaid  by the said firm by paying the same to the  credit  ofthe applicant Mills with British Indian banks or shroffs.\"Now,  it is evident from this that Jagmohandas & Company  donot  merely  guarantee payment by the Ahmedabad\\t buyers\\t butactually  make the payments, or the equivalent of  payments,to  the assessee company.  So little do the  \\'buyers  matterthat  their  transactions  are not  even  reflected  in\\t theaccounts.   All we have is Jagmohandas.\\t It does not, in  myopinion, matter whether the actual buyers remained primarilyand  legally responsible to the assessee or not.   The\\tfactremains that in practice Jagmohandas & Company actually\\t metthe   obligations  of  the  buyers  and\\t  discharged   theirliabilities  to\\t the  assessee. it is,\\tequally\\t clear\\tthatJagmohandas & Company must have recouped themselves in\\tsomeway from the buyers.  The question is how.  If the whole  ofthe  transactions  occurred outside British  India  and\\t thebuyers or their agents went to Petlad and received the goodsthere and paid Jagmohandas & \\'Company outside British India,then I am clear that the profits and gains did not accrue orarise  in  British India, simply be-cause  the\\t(foods\\twereultimately  brought there.  But if Jagmohandas & Company  ortheir  agents  were paid in British India, the\\tprofits\\t andgains, in my opinion, arose there in the same way as in\\t the4  lakhs  case.\\t If Jagmohandas & Company  were\\t the  actualagents of the assessee as were the banks in the other  case,and the payments were made in the taxable territories,\\tthenthe accrual and arising was direct.  If, however, they\\twerenot the agents in the strict sense of the term, then I am ofopinion\\t that section 42 would be attracted because  at\\t thevery least there would be a \"business connection\",972provided  of  course the payments were made in\\tthe  taxableterritories.\\nNow, here again., I am looking to what was actually done  inorder  to determine what the rights were, for it is  evidentthat what was done was done in pursuance of some  agreement,express\\t or  implied, between the  parties  which  agreementregulated  their rights, and those rights in turn  determinethe  place  where  the profits accrued or  arose,  or  must,because of section 42, be deemed to have accrued or arisen.In my view, the question referred by the Incometax AppellateTribunal  in its statement of the case does not reflect\\t thetrue   position\\t because  it  concentrates  on\\tthe   actualreceipts.   If\\tthe  cash basis\\t system\\t of  accounting\\t wasgermane\\t here, then I would agree that the Rs. 4,40,878\\t waspart of the assessee\\'s income in British India, and so\\talsoin  the\\t other\\tcase, provided the  payments  were  made  inBritish\\t India.\\t But it is misleading to enquire what  wouldhave  happened\\tin circumstances which are not\\tmaterial  inthis  case  because of the mercantile system  of  accountingwhich was employed.\\nAs regards the High Court.  The learned Judges refrained thequestion  and answered it without sending the case  back  tothe Income-tax Appellate Tribunal for a further statement ofthe  case.   That  was\\tnot strictly  proper.\\tBut,  in  myopinion,  the  refrained  questions  suffer  from  the\\tsamedefect.\\nIn  my opinion, the case should be sent back to the  Income-tax  Appellate\\tTribunal for a refraining of  the  questionsalong the lines I have indicated and for a further statementof the case.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\nAgent for the appellants: Rajinder Narain.Agent for the respondents: G.

Raghuraj Singh was not  slow  inseeking\\t the aid of these laws to reduce the amount  of\\t hisindebtedess and to save his property.  He made\\tapplicationsunder  both the Acts.  In the application under\\t the  ReliefAct  he\\t prayed for the scaring down of the  amount  of\\t thedecree\\tand  for  instalments.\\t In  the  application  undersection\\t 4  of\\tthe  Encumbered Estates\\t Act  he  asked\\t forliquidation ,of his debts by the civil judge.On  the\\t 11th  January, 1936, the  civil  judge\\t of  Sitapuraltered\\t the  decretal\\tamount of Rs.  3,88,300-2-6  to\\t Rs.3,76,790-4-3  exclusive\\t of costs and  future  interest\\t anddirected  Raghuraj  Singh to pay the money in  twelve  equalannual instalments payable in the month of December of\\teachyear, the first instalment being payable in December,  1936,and also provided that in the case of default in payment  ofthree  instalments, the whole amount then due  would  becomeimmediately  payable.  Against this order, Hari\\t Kishen\\t Dasfiled an application in revision to the Chief Court and\\t wassuccessful  in having the amended decree set aside  on\\t15thFebruary, 1938.\\nIn  the proceedings commenced under the\\t Encumbered  EstatesAct on 29th October, 1936, Raghuraj Singh obtained an  orderunder  section\\t6 of the Act but this order  was  eventuallyquashed\\t by the Board of Revenue on 13th August,  1938,\\t andthe debtor\\'s application under section 4 was dismissed.Having\\tsucceeded  in his application in  revision  in\\ttheChief  Court,  Hari Kishen Das revived\\tthe  proceedings  inexecution of the compromise decree and called upon  RaghurajSingh  to  execute a sale deed in respect  of  the  selectedvillages in his favour.\\t On his failure to comply with\\tthisdemand, the court563executed  a  deed of sale in his favour\\t on  24th  February,1939,  and in due course delivered to him possession of\\t theproperty covered by the deed.\\nThakur\\tRaghuraj Singh died in -the year 1941,\\tleaving\\t himsurviving   the\\t present  appellant  as\\t his  successor\\t  ininterest.   An\\tappeal\\thad been taken by  him\\tagainst\\t thedecision  of  the  Chief Court dated  15th  February,  1938,setting aside the amended decree to His Majesty in  Council.By  an\\torder  of  His Majesty in  Council  passed  on\\t20thJanuary,  1944, the decision of the Chief Court\\t dated\\t15thFebruary,  1938, was reversed and the amended decree  passedby  the\\t Civil Judge of Sitapur on 11th January,  1936,\\t wasrestored.   Liberty was given to the appellant to  apply  tothe court of the civil judge, Sitapur, for such relief as hemight  be  entitled  to with reference to  the\\trecovery  ofpossession of the property.\\nIn view of the decision of the Privy Council, Bhagwant Singh(appellant)   made   an\\t application  for   restoration\\t  ofpossession and for recovery of profit:,, wrongfully realizedby  Hari Kishen Das and after his death by his\\tadopted\\t sonSri  Kishen Das.  This application was strenuously  resistedby  the creditor and it was pleaded by him that\\t even  underthe  amended  decree  a sum of\\tRs.  4,31,148-9-9  includinginterest and costs had become due to the decreeholder on thedate of the sale since three instalments which had till thenfallen\\tdue had remained unpaid and the default\\t clause\\t hadcome  into operation and the sale in execution could not  beset aside, as it has not caused any injury to the  judgment-debtor\\tand  had not in any way caused loss to\\thim  in\\t theabsence\\t of  proof  that  he  had  the\\tmoney  to  pay\\t theinstalments.\\nThe   subordinate   judge  allowed   the   application\\t forrestitution conditional on Bhagwant Singh paying within\\t twomonths\\tthe  accumulated  sum that had\\tfallen\\tdue  to\\t thedecreeholder under the unpaid instalments up to the date  ofthe  order.  He held that the arrears up to December,  1943,came to Rs. 3,58,914-8-9, and deducting from this amount thenet profits73564realized  during the period of his possession  amounting  toRs. 73,294-8-5 and the costs of appeal allowed by the  PrivyCouncil,  a.  sum of Rs. 2,85,620-074 was due  and  directedthat  if this amount was not deposited in court\\t within\\t twomonths,\\t the  application would stand  dismissed.   BhagwantSingh applied for extension of time but this application wassummarily dismissed.\\nRai Sabib Sri Kishen Das and Bhagwant Singh both appealed tothe  Chief Court against this decision.\\t The appeal  of\\t SriKishen Das was numbered as 103 of 1944.\\t His contention\\t wasthat the judgment-debtor was not entitled to restitution  atall.   The  appeal of Bhagwant Singh was numbered as  23  of1945.  His grievance was that he wag entitled to restitutionwithout\\t  any  condition.   The\\t Chief\\tCourt  allowed\\t thedecreeholder\\'s appeal (103 of 1944) with costs and dismissedthe judgment-debtor\\'s appeal (23 of 1945) but without costs,and  dismissed\\tthe application of the\\tjudgment-debtor\\t forrestitution on the 13th March, 1946.  Appeals 102 and 103 of1951 arise out of this decision.\\nAppeal No. 101 of 1951 arises out of another decision of theChief  Court  dated 13 th March, 1946, which  confirmed\\t thedecree\\tdated 26th September, 1943, of the special judge  ofSitapur\\t under the Encumbered Estates Act.  The facts  aboutthis matter are these :\\nAs  already stated, on 28th October, 1936,  Thakur  RagburajSingh applied under section 4 of the U.P. Encumbered EstatesAct (XXV of 1934) for administration of his estate so as  toliquidate  his\\tdebts amounting to about 14 lakhs.  on\\t13thAugust,\\t 1938, the Board of Revenue quashed the\\t proceedingsunder  the  Encumbered\\tEstates\\t Act  initiated\\t by   ThakurRaghuraj   Singh.   As\\tno  order  for\\tstay  of   executionproceedings  was obtained by Raghuraj Singh from  the  ChiefCourt or the Privy Council, the civil judge to whom the exe-cution proceedings had been transferred, on 13th565February,  1939,  ordered the judgment-debtor to  execute  asale  deed  and on his making a default the civil  judge  on24th  February, 1939, executed a sale deed on behalf of\\t thejudgment-debtor\\t in, favour of Rai Bahadur Hari Kishen\\tDas.The U.P. Encumbered Estates Amendment Act (XI of 1939)\\tcameinto  operation after this sale.  It allowed the  applicantsto amend their applications, proceedings in respect of whichhad  been  quashed previously.\\tOn the 10th  October,  1939,Raghuraj  Singh\\t applied for amendment of  his\\tapplication.This  application was allowed by the sub-divisional  officerwho  passed an order under section 6 of the U.P.  EncumberedEstates Act on 18th October, 1939, and forwarded the amendedapplication to the special judge, first grade, Sitapur.\\t  On31st  July, 1940, the special judge passed an order  to\\t theeffect\\tthat the proceedings would start  afresh.   RaghurajSingh  went up in revision to the Chief Court  against\\tthisorder  contending that the proceedings should not be  deemedas  fresh  proceedings.\\t  The  Chief  Court  dismissed\\t therevision  on 9th December, 1940.  On a\\tnotification  issuedunder section 11 of the Encumbered Estates Act, Hari  KishenDas  filed objection on 14th August, 1942, under section  11claiming that the villages sold to him were his property andwere  not  liable to be attached and sold for the  debts  ofRaghuraj Singh.\\t This objection was contested by the debtor.The special judge by his decree dated 25th September,  1943,declared Rai Bahadur Hari Kishen Das to be the proprietor ofall  the  eight villages included in the sale deed  of\\t24thFebruary, 1939.\\t Against the decree of the special judge  anappeal\\twas  filed in the Chief Court which  confirmed\\tthatdecree\\ton  13th March, 1946.  Appeal No. 101  of  1951\\t nowbefore us is directed against that decree.This  appeal  can be shortly disposed of.   The\\t proceedingsunder the Encumbered Estates Act having been quashed by\\t theBoard of Revenue in August, 1938, the sale held in February,1939, was unaffected by the bar imposed by section 7 of\\t theAct.  In566view of the decision of the Chief Court dated 9th  December,1940,  the  appellant could not be allowed  to\\tagitate\\t thepoint  that  the proceedings should have been deemed  to  bepending in February,.1939, because of the provisions of\\t theamending  Act.\\t This point was stressed before\\t us  by\\t thelearned counsel for the appellant and he contended that\\t theprovisions  of the amending Act XI of 1939 should have\\tbeengiven  retrospective operation and the date of his  originalapplication  should  have been treated as the  date  of\\t thestart  of the proceedings under the Encumbered Estates\\tAct.This  contention, in our opinion, was rightly  negatived  inthe  courts  below, and it was rightly held that  the  ordermade  under section 6 on 18th October, 1939, was made  on  afresh  application under section 4. of the  U.P.  EncumberedEstates Act preferred on 10th October, 1939, and this  couldnot affect the validity of the sale deed executed at a\\ttimewhen  no  application under section 4 was pending.   It\\t wasargued in the courts below that the sale deed  was a nullitybecause\\t it  was executed while execution  proceedings\\twerepending before the collector under schedule III of the\\tCodeof  Civil Procedure.  The point was not argued before us  inthis  appeal.  This appeal therefore fails and is  dismissedwith costs.\\nAs  regards  appeals Nos. 102 and 103, the  main  point\\t fordecision  is whether in the circumstances of this  case\\t theappellant was entitled to restitution by way of\\t restorationof possession and grant of mesne profits after the  reversalof  the\\t compromise  decree by the  Privy  Council  and\\t therestoration  of\\t the amended decree as passed by  the  civiljudge under the Relief Act.\\nHaving regard to the provisions of section 144 of the  Codeof Civil Procedure, the Chief Court was of the opinion\\tthatthe  sale  in 1939 was inevitable and could  not  have\\tbeenavoided\\t if  the amended decree had been then in  force\\t andthat if it was set aside it would confer on the appellant anadvantage  to  which his predecessor was  not  entitled,  hehaving defaulted567in  the\\t payment of three instalments before the  sale\\ttookplace.\\tThe following passage from the judgment of the ChiefCourt expresses the view that it took on this point :-\"For  purposes\\tof section 144 we have in the words  of\\t thesection\\t \\'to place, the parties in the position\\t which\\ttheywould have occupied but for such decree or such part thereofas  has been varied or reversed.\\' So placing them the  issuewhich falls for determination is whether the judgment-debtorwould have paid the accumulated amount of three\\t instalmentsnamely Rs. 1,37,839-1-11 in December, 1939.  On the evidencethe  lower  court has come to the conclusion with  which  weagree  that Thakur Raghuraj Singh owed no less\\tthan  rupeesfourteen  lakhs to other creditors, and computing the  valueof  the entire landed property at the rate specified in\\t thecompromise  of\\t1133, it was only rupees  nine\\tlakhs.\\t LalBhagwant  Singh produced no evidence to establish  that\\t hisfather\\twas  otherwise in a position to pay  the  amount  ofthree instalments in December, 1938.  We may mention that noobjection  has\\tbeen  taken at the bar to  the\\testimate  ofindebtedness  or  to the evaluation of the  estate.   Takingthem,  therefore, to be correct it is impossible to  believethat  the judgment-debtor could have prevented the  sale  on24th  February, 1939, if the parties were then\\tgoverned  bythe   decree  of  1936.\\t  The  result  which  followed\\t wasinevitable and cannot be attributed solely to the  erroneousorder passed by this court in February, 1938.\"In our opinion, no exception can be taken to the judgment ofthe Chief Court in the facts and circumstances of this\\tcaseand both these appeals would therefore have to be dismissed.On  account  of\\t the order of His  Majesty  in\\tCouncil\\t theamended\\t decree passed by the civil judge, Sitapur, on\\t11thJanuary,  1936, must be deemed to have been  subsisting\\t allalong.\\tAll the terms of the compromise were embodied in theamended\\t decree\\t and  there was no  difference\\tin  the\\t twodecrees except for the reduction of568the  sum due from Rs. 3,88,300-2-6 to Rs.  3,76,790-4-3\\t andthe  reduction of pendente lite and future interest and\\t forprovision  for instalments.  The compromise decree with\\t thenecessary  adaptations\\tand amendments\\tbecame\\tthe  amendeddecree\\tand was enforceable as such.  It gave the  judgment-debtor, an opportunity to satisfy the decree by\\t instalmentsif  he\\tcommitted no default and to save the  property\\tfrombeing  sold  in\\t satisfaction of it but in  case  the  wholeamount of the decree became due according to its terms or ifany  portion  of  it  remained unpaid,\\tit  yet\\t had  to  besatisfied  in  the same manner as  the\\toriginal  compromisedecree.\\t  During the pendency of the decreeholder\\'s,  appealbefore\\tthe Chief Court the judgment-debtor did\\t not  obtainany  order staying the operation of the amended decree.\\t  Hewas thus bound to carry out the terms of that decree but  hefailed\\tto pay any of the instalments that fell due in\\t1936or  1937.   The third instalment, it is true,  fell  due  inDecember, 1938, after the amended decree had been set  asideby the Chief Court but the judgment-debtor had appealed\\t forits  restoration to the Privy Council.\\tHe should  thereforehave taken steps to protect himself against being in defaultwith  payment of three instalments.  In order  therefore  toavoid  the  default  which  he\\twould  otherwise  commit  bynonpayment of the third instalment it was obligatory on\\t himto pay or offer to pay to the decree-holder an amount  equalto  the amount of one instalment so that  three\\t instalmentswill not be in arrears, or to obtain an order from the PrivyCouncil\\t absolving him from complying with the terms of\\t theamended decree set aside by the Chief Court, even if it\\t waseventually restored.  Failing that, he should have  obtaineda fresh order from the Privy Council fixing the\\t instalmentsand  time  for the payment.  He, however,  did\\tnothing\\t andadopted\\t the  attitude\\tthat he need  make  no\\tpayment\\t andconsidered  himself  absolved  from  satisfying\\t either\\t theoriginal  decree or the amended decree.\\t The result of\\tthisattitude  was that the whole of the decretal  amount  becamedue on his569failure\\t to pay the third instalment provided for under\\t theamended\\t decree\\t in  December, 1938, and he  thus  lost\\t thebenefit\\t of paying the decretal amount by instalments.\\t Theamount due  from him in February, 1939 under the decree\\t wasthe same sum for which the property was sold in execution ofthe  original  decree. In this situation it cannot  be\\tsaidthat there was any alteration in the position of the partiesby thePrivy Council setting aside the compromise decree\\t andrestoring the decree passed by the civil judge, Sitapur,  in1936.  The position would have been the same if that  decreewas a subsisting one and was in execution.  If the judgment-debtor could have shown that he was in a position to pay theaggregate amount of the instalments in December, 1938, or atleast  one instalment so that he could not be said  to\\thavedefaulted in the payment of three instalments, then the salemade  in February, 1939, could not possibly be\\tregarded  asone  under the amended decree but could only have been\\tmadein  consequence of the original compromise decree, and\\tthatcompromise  decree  having been superseded and\\tthe  amendeddecree\\thaving\\tbeen  restored,\\t the  sale  held  under\\t thereversed decree would surely have to be set a-side.  On\\t theother hand, if the sale could not have been avoided even  ifthe amended decree which was eventually restored had been inoperation  at the time of the sale by reason of\\t default  ofpayment\\t of  three  instalments\\t and the  sale\\twas  also  anecessary  consequence under the decree of the\\tcivil  judgeand  was  inevitable, then it cannot be said that  the\\tsaleheld  in February, 1939,-was the result and  consequence  ofthe reversed decree.  It is true that it is one of the firstand  the highest duty of a court to take care that its\\tactsdo  not\\t injure\\t any of the suitors and if  any\\t injury\\t wascaused\\tto the judgmentdebtor by the sale held in  February,1931, it was our duty to undo the wrong caused to him.\\t It,however, cannot be said that in this case any wrong has beendone  to  the judgment-debtor which we are  called  upon  toredress.  It is not possible to hold that he570was  under no obligation to satisfy either one or the  otherof the two decrees, and that he was absolved from satisfyingthe  instalment decree because it had been set aside by\\t theChief  Court  and he was also absolved from  satisfying\\t theoriginal  decree  because it was later on set aside  by\\t thePrivy Council.\\tHaving himself appealed to the Privy Councilfor  the  restoration  of  the\\tinstalment  decree,  it\\t wasobligatory  on him to carry out the terms of that decree  ifhe  wanted  to\\ttake advantage of  its\\tprovisions.   Havingdefaulted in this, he must take its consequences, which\\t arenow different from the consequences of the original  decree.Indeed,\\t if in this case the prayer of\\tthe  judgment-debtorfor  restitution was granted, it would result in  doing\\t notonly  an injustice but a wrong to the decreeholder  and\\t thecourt  would not be acting fairly and rightly  towards\\thim.As  already said, in February 1939 both under  the  originaldecree\\tand  the amended decree a sum of  over\\trupees\\tfourlakhs became due to him and he was entitled to got a sale ofthe   villages\\tselected  by  him  in  his  favour   towardssatisfaction  of  this decretal debt.  If this sale  is\\t setaside  and possession of eight villages is restored  to\\t thejudgment-debtor and mesne profits are decreed in his favour,the  decreeholder  would be deprived of the  fruits  of\\t hisdecree which is certainly not the purpose of restitution  inlaw  or\\t equity;  it would place the  judgment-debtor  in  aposition  of  advantage to which he is\\tnot  entitled.\\t Theexecuting  court  decreed restoration of possession  of\\t theeight villages in favour of the appellant conditional on hispaying the amount due to the decreeholder under the  amendeddecree\\ttill  the  date\\t of  that  order.   This   obviouslyfavourable order passed in his favour by the trial judge wasnot  availed  of by the judgment-debtor as he has  no  meanswhatsoever to make any payment.\\t An order of restitution  inthe manner asked for in the circumstances of this case wouldbe contrary to the principles of the doctrine of restitutionwhich  is that on the reversal of a judgment the law  raisesan obligation on the party to the record who received the571benefit of the erroneous judgment to make restitution to theother party for what he had lost and- that it is the duty ofthe court to enforce that obligation unless it is shown thatrestitution would be clearly contrary to the real justice ofthe case.  The decreeholder in the present case has  derivedno advantage* to which he was not entitled and the judgment-debtor\\thas  lost  nothing.   In  either  event\\t he  had  todischarge and satisfy the decretal debt due from him whetherunder  the  first decree or under the second and  that\\tdebtcould only be discharged by sale of the villages selected bythe  decreeholder.  In the words of Rankin C. J.  in  Dayal.Sardar v. Tari Deshi(1), the judgmentdebtor is not  entitledto recover the properties except upon showing that the\\tsalewas in substance and truth a consequence of the error in thereversed  decree.   The\\t sale  being  inevitable  under\\t theamended decree the \\'judgment-debtor was clearly not entitledto  restitution.  It was held in, Gansu Ram v. Parvati\\tKuer(2),  that where a judgment-debtor could not have paid\\teventhe reduced decretal amount and the sum realized at the salewas  less than the decretal amount the situation  could\\t nothave  been altered in any way had the decree  been  modifiedbefore,\\t instead of after the sale, and the  judgment-debtorcould  not invoke the provisions of section 144,  except  byshowing\\t that  the  sale  was  in  substance  and  truth   aconsequence  of\\t the  error in\\tthe  original  decree.,\\t Theobservations made in this case have apposite application  tothe facts and circumstances of this case.\\nFor the reasons given above we are of the opinion that thereis  no merit in either of these appeals and we dismiss\\tbothof them with costs.\\nAppeals dismissed.\\nAgent for the appellant: C.

We  have,therefore,  to\\tread the words used in the body\\t of  section18(1)  of the 195O Act and if we find the meaning clear\\t andunambiguous\\'  the marginal note should not be  permitted  tocreate\\tan ambiguity in the section. Section 18 (1),  as  itstood  on the 4th July, 1950, when the order for  possessionpassed on the 27th February, 1950, was vacated, gave  reliefto  a  tenant  against\\twhom  any  decree  for\\trecovery  ofpossession  of any premises had been made on the  ground  ofdefault\\t in payment of arrears of rent under the  provisionsof  the\\t 1948  Act,  provided that  the\\t possession  of\\t thepremises had not been recovered from him.  The relief  givenby  this section is clearly against a decree for  possessionwhich  \"has been made\" under the 1948 Act.  The language  ofsection\\t 18  (1)  of  the 1950 Act  and\\t in  particular\\t thespecific  reference therein to the Act of 1948 take us\\tbackto that Act.  Section II of the 1948 Act %refers \" to  orderor decree for the recovery of possession of, any  premises\".The  reference in the non obstante clause of section  11  tothe  Presidency\\t Small\\tCause Courts  Act,  I  882,  clearlyindicates  that\\t the order for the  recovery  of  possessionrefers\\tto  orders  passed  under section  43  of  the\\tlastmentioned Act on applications made under section 41 thereof.Section\\t 11  speaks of both \" order \" for  the\\trecovery  ofpossession  and \" decree \" for the recovery  of\\t possession.Therefore, there can remain no manner of doubt that the\\t twowords  \"  order \" and \" decree \" in section 11\\tconnote\\t twodifferent things.  This is further made clear by the use  oftwo  words \" suit \" or \" proceeding \" in section 12  of\\t the1948  Act.  It is, thus, quite clear that in the 1948 Act  \"suit  \"\\t is different from \" proceeding\" and \"\\torder  \"  isdifferent from \" decree \". Therefore, in construing the 1948Act there can be no occasion for giving any extended meaningto the word \" decree\" so as to include \"order\", for the\\t twoare distinctly and separately provided for.  Section 18\\t (1)of Act XVII of 1950 does not refer to \"decree\"\\nsimpliciter but to \"any decree for recovery of possession ofany premises on the ground of default in payment of  arrearsof rent under the provisions of\" the 1948 Act.\\tTurning thento  that  Act we find that a decree for\\t possession  on\\t theground\\tof  non-payment of rent under that  Act\\t is  treateddistinctly  from  an order for possession on the  ground  ofnon-payment  of rent under the same Act.  A decree  for\\t therecovery  of possession within the meaning of that Act\\tcan,therefore,  only  mean a decree in a suit  for\\trecovery  ofpossession  and cannot cover an order for possession  passedunder section 43 on an application made under section 41  ofthe  Presidency Small Cause Courts Act.\\t In  short,  section18(1)  of Act XVII of 1950 expressly attracts the  1948\\t Actand  under that Act there can be no necessity for giving  anextended meaning to the word \"decree\", for \"order \" is sepa-rately dealt with in that Act.\\nIt  is said that whatever the word \"decree\" may mean in\\t the1948 Act it is immaterial for the purposes of construing ActXVII  of 1950 for the Court has to ascertain the meaning  ofthe  word  \"decree\"  as used in section 18(1)  of  the\\tlastmentioned Act.\\tIt has been already stated that the languageof  section 18 (1) attracts the relevant provisions  of\\t the1948  Act  and, therefore, the word  \"decree\"  occurring  insection 18(1) must necessarily be construed in the light  ofthe  1948  Act and it is clear that so construed  it  cannotcover  \"order\" for possession made under Chapter VII of\\t thePresidency  Small  Cause  Courts  Act.\\t Apart\\tfrom\\'\\tthatconsideration,\\tthe  question still remains: What  does\\t theword  \"decree\"\\tin section 18 (1) mean?\\t That word  has\\t notbeen  defined either in the 1948 Act or in Act XVII of\\t1950or  in the Bengal General Clauses Act.\\tThat word,  however,has been defined in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908,\\tand,as  there  defined,  it means the formal  expression  of  anadjudication which determines the rights of the parties withregard\\tto the matter in controversy in the suit which\\tlastword  prima  facie means a civil proceeding initiated  by  aplaint (section 26 and Order IV, rule 1,541Civil  Procedure  Code).   This\\t is  the  ordinary  acceptedmeaning\\t of  the  word \" decree \" and  if  that\\t meaning  isattributed to the word \" decree \" occurring in section 18(1)then clearly it cannot cover an order for possession  passedunder section 43 of the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act onan application made under section 41 of that Act.It is, however, urged that the word \" decree\" in -section 18(1)  of\\t Act XVII of 1950 should not be read in\\t its  strictsense.\\tIt is said that although the word \"suit\"  ordinarilymeans  a proceeding instituted by a plaint, it is also\\tusedin  a wider sense so as to cover proceedings which  are\\t notinstituted  by a plaint and, therefore., an adjudication  inthose  proceedings  which are also suits  in  that  extendedmeaning\\t may well be said to be a \" decree\".   Reference  ismade to the explanation of sub-section (1) of section 12  ofAct  XVII  of  1950, which expressly provides  that  in\\t theproviso to sub-section (1) the term \"suit\" does not  includeproceeding  under Chapter VII of the Presidency Small  CauseCourts\\tAct,  1882, and it is urged  that  this\\t explanationinferentially means that the word \" suit \" occurring in\\t theother sections of Act XVII of 1950 may include a  proceedingunder  Chapter VII of the Presidency Small Cause Courts\\t Actand,  therefore, an order made on such a proceeding  may  bedescribed  as  an adjudication in a suit and,  therefore,  adecree.\\t  It is not quite clear how this inference, even  ifit  can\\t be  properly drawn, can have  any  bearing  on\\t theconstruction  of  the word \"decree\" in\\tsub-section  (1)  ofsection\\t 18 of the Act XVII of 1960 where the word \" suit  \"is not used at all.  Be that as it may, the argument foundedon  the\\t aforesaid  inference sought to be  drawn  from\\t theexplanation  to\\t section  12 (1) of Act XVII  of  1950\\twillclearly\\t appear to be untenable when the provisions of\\tthatAct are closely scrutinised, for it will then be found\\tthatthe word \" suit\" does not and was not intended to cover\\t anyproceeding  under Chapter VII of the Presidency Small  CauseCourts\\tAct.   Section 12 (1) prohibits the  making  of\\t anyorder or decree for the -\\nrecovery   of  possession  by  any  Court,   notwithstandinganything to the contrary in any other Act or law.  This sub-section\\t (1),  standing by itself, means that no  order\\t forpossession can be passed by the Presidency Small Cause Courtnotwithstanding the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act and nodecree\\tfor possession can be made by any Court in any\\tsuitnotwithstanding the Transfer of Property Act or the ContractAct  or the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.  The\\t proviso  tosub-section  (1),  however, saves \"any suit for\\t decree\\t forsuch  recovery of possession\" against certain tenants or  incertain\\t circumstances.\\t  Therefore, it is  clear  that\\t theproviso\\t to  sub-section  (1) of section 12  does  not\\tsaveproceedings under Chapter VII of the Presidency Small  CauseCourts\\tAct.   The explanation to that\\tsub-section  statingthat  the  word\\t \"suit\" in the proviso does  not  include  aproceeding  under Chapter VII of the Presidency Small  CauseCourts\\tAct  appears to have been inserted out\\tof  abundantcaution to put the position beyond any doubt.  Section 16 ofAct  XVII  of 1950 provides  that  notwithstanding  anythingcontained  in any other law a suit by a landlord  against  atenant\\tfor recovery of possession of any premises to  whichthe  Act  applies  shall lie to the Courts  as\\tset  out  inSchedule  B  and that no other Court shall be  competent  toentertain or try such suit.  According to Schedule B,  wherethe premises are situate on land wholly within the  ordinaryoriginal  civil jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court\\t andwhen the rent does not -exceed Rs. 500 per month, the  ChiefJudge of the Calcutta Court of Small Causes shall  entertainand try such suit as a Court of the District Judge, providedthat be shall be entitled to transfer the suit to any  otherJudge  of  that\\t Court who shall try it as a  Court  of\\t theSubordinate  Judge.  The result of sections 12 and  16\\treadwith Schedule B is for all practical purposes to suspend theoperation  of  Chapter\\tVII of the  Presidency\\tSmall  CauseCourts\\tAct in Calcutta for no one will take proceedings  inwhich no order can be made.  The effect of those sections isto confer a new jurisdiction on the543Chief  Judge of the Calcutta Small Cause Court to  entertainand  try suits by landlords against tenants for recovery  ofpossession of premises situate within the ordinary  originalcivil  jurisdiction  of\\t the Calcutta High  Court  when\\t themonthly\\t rent does not exceed Rs. 600.\\tThus after Act\\tXVIIof  1950 came into force the Calcutta Small Cause Court\\t hasceased\\tto  have any power to pass an order  for  possessionunder  Chapter VII of the Presidency Small Cause Courts\\t Actand the Small Cause Court of Calcutta can, under that  Act,,only  pass a decree for possession in a suit Which is  savedby  the\\t proviso to sub-section (1) of section 12  and\\twithregard to which a special jurisdiction is conferred on\\tthatCourt  by section 16 of that Act.  That being the  position,the word\" suit \" in none of the sections of Act XVII of 1950can  be\\t said to have been used as including  -a  proceedingunder Chapter VII of the Presidency Small Cause Courts\\tAct.Therefore, the reasoning advanced in support of\\t attributingan   extended\\tmeaning\\t to  the  word\\t \"suit\"\\t  and\\ttheninferentially to the word decree \" in section 18 (1)  cannotbe sustained.\\nIt  is\\tnext argued that if the word \"decree\"  is  construedstrictly it will give rise to startling results in that poortenants\\t against  whom orders for possesSion had  been\\tmadeunder  the  1948  Act will be deprived\\tof  the\\t benefit  ofsection 18 (1) while the wealthy tenants paying rents  aboveRs.  500  per month will get relief under that\\tsection\\t andthis will frustrate the intention of the Legislature.\\tThisargument  proceeds  on the assumption that  the\\t Legislatureintended  to give relief to all tenants against whom  ordersor  decrees for possession had been made.  The\\tlanguage  ofsection\\t 18  (1)  clearly shows that the  intention  of\\t theLegislature  was to give relief only to certain\\t tenants  incertain\\t circumstances.\\t In the first place relief is  givenonly  with  respect  to decree for possession  made  on\\t thespecified  ground  and\\tnot with respect  to  a\\t decree\\t forpossession  made  on any other ground.\\tIn  the\\t next  placerelief is given only when the possession of the premises  inrespect of which a544decree\\tfor possession had been made had not been made\\toverby  the\\t tenant.   Thus tenants against whom  a\\t decree\\t forpossession  had been made on grounds other than\\t the  groundspecified. in the subs section and even tenants against whoma  decree  for\\tpossession had been made  on  the  specifiedground\\tbut  who had, voluntarily  or  otherwise,  deliveredpossession  of the premises get no relief under\\t section  18(1).

The Legislature may well  have  thoughtthat  cases where orders for possession had been made  underChapter\\t VII of the Presidency Small Cause Courts  Act\\twithrespect to premises which were situate within the small areaof the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the  CalcuttaHigh Court and which, in spite of such orders, were still inthe   possession  of  the  tenants  at\\tthe  date   of\\t thecommencement  of Act XVII of 1950 would be few in number  ascompared to the number of cases where decrees for possessionhad  been made with respect to premises which  were  situatewithin\\ta very much larger area and which were still in\\t thepossession of the tenants and, therefore, did not think\\t fitto provide for those few cases.\\t It must always be borne  inmind,  as said by Lord Halsbury in Commissioner for  SpecialPurposes  of  Income  Tax  v.

Since 1948 there had been quarrels between the members of these factions and in 1949 proceedings under Section 107, Cr. P. C. were taken against both but after some time they were dropped and a settlement was reached between them. The settlement, however, was shortlived as within a few weeks they quarrelled again and some of them abused and beat each other. Security proceedings were again taken against them in March 1950. Some members of Sunder's party were bound over, but Sunder himself and his brother, Munde, and two others were discharged. Proceedings against Purshotham, Pratap and his brother Durga were pending, when Sunder was shot dead on 6th April 1950.\\nAppellant Ramnath did not belong to either of the factions and he was not involved in the Section 107 proceedings of 1949 or 1950. But it is alleged that in 1948 Hari Shankar, his sister's grandson, was beaten by Sunder or by his friend Ramrattan, P. W. 42, and that in a gambling quarrel between Sunder and Ramnath, the former beat Ramnath with a shoe and the latter threatened to see Sunder killed. In 1949 Sunder received three anonymous letters which were handed over to the police . The approver Hanna, is a milkman of Gadarwara and sells pan and bidi. He was originally in Sunder's faction and was bound over under Section 107 in March 1950.\\nIt is said that about a fortnight before the murder he demanded two rupees from Sunder's brother, Munde (P. W. 11), which were due to him for supply of pan and bidi but Munde refused to pay and abused him. Upset at this incident, he decided to leave Sunder's party and join the opposite faction of Pratap and Purshotham. As usual with new recruits, he started taking an active part in the meetings of the other faction. Some of these meetings were held at Pratap's hotel and the last two at Purshotham's house. In these meetings it was decided to kill Sunder. In pursuance of this conspiracy it was settled that Sunder should be taken behind the ganj and killed there without delay.\\nPratap agreed to go to the ganj where Sunder was attending a meeting, to call him. He was followed by the other three, to whom he subsequently reported that Sunder had told him that he would see him on the following morning. Ramnath then hired Chiddi's tonga and he and his companions went to a place on the main road where Sunder was expected to pass on his way home from the meeting. They entered a lane and after a few minutes Pratap went to pee whether Sunder was coming. He reported that he was on his way flashing a torch from time to time. Shortly after, Ramnath and Purshotham emerged from the lane, while Hanna and Pratap remained in it, and Ramnath fired two shots at Sunder at close range. Sunder flashed his torch and collapsed. Ramnath fired another shot at him before he and his companions took to flight. Hearing Sunder's cries, some persons living in the neighbouring houses came to the spot and heard Sunder cursing by same persons who he thought were his assailants.\"}", "subPara": "{}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'7': 'The charge of conspiracy under Section 120-B was sought to be established from the direct evidence of the approver Hanna, P. W. 1, and Shibbu (P. W. 8) and from other circumstantial evidence. The learned sessions judge held that the alleged express and sustained criminal conspiracy as alleged in the charge was not proved. The approver\\'s testimony was rejected as worthless in view of the variety of versions on material particulars of the incident given by him on different occasions. Shibbu was held to be an outright accomplice like Hanna with the difference that the latter was a pardoned accomplice while the former was not.\\nThe learned sessions judge further held that there was no independent corroboration worth the name even in the circumstantial evidence as to the alleged criminal conspiracy. The State Government did not file an appeal against the acquittal of the appellants under Section 120-B and the charge, therefore, under Section 120-B must be taken to have failed. While dealing with the approver\\'s evidence, the High Court observed that it was difficult to discard the whole of the approver\\'s testimony but it did not proceed further to record any positive finding as to the portion of the evidence of the approver it considered trustworthy. In para. 49 of its judgment the High Court Stated its conclusion in the following terms.\\n\"Our conclusions are, shortly stated, that the material on record showed that Sunder was shot by a member of, the group which consisted of the appellants and Hanna but that it did not definitely show that Ramnath was the firer, although it was probable that he was, because of his experience in the use of a firearm and his expressed desire to have his enemy Sunder shot. His conviction under Section 302 alone of the I. P. C. cannot in the circumstances be sustained; and the appellants\\' learned counsel contended that as the other appellants and he were acquitted under Section 120-B, they could not now be convicted under Section 302 read with Section 34. This argument was based on the hypothesis that the acquittal under Section 120-B connoted the applicability of Section 34, because the facts which resulted in the acquittal under Section\\' 120-B were the same as those which would render resort to Section 34 unwarranted. This contention, was, as adumbrated, one which would have been readily met, if an appeal against the appellants\\' acquittal under Section 120-B had been, as it should have been, filed by the State. We say so, because the case was undoubtedly one in which there had been a conspiracy of the character contemplated by Sub-section (1) of Section 120-B, I. P.

W. 2, and Ramswarup, P. W. 4. Nanha is the father of the approver Hanna. The learned sessions judge held that Nanha and Ramswarup witnessed the shooting and that though Ramswarup could not identify either the assailant or his one companion there was no reason to disbelieve Nanha when he said that he identified Ramnath as the person who actually shot Sunder.\\nIt was further remarked that Nanha and Ramswarup's statement that the assailant shot Sunder from the front was not correct, and that the witnesses mistook the respective position of Sunder and of the assailant at the moment of the firing. On this evidence the learned sessions judge reached the conclusion that Ramnath was actually the person who shot Sunder and that Pratap and Purshotham and Hanna were his companions. Reliance was also placed on the dying declaration which implicated the appellants. It was in view of this finding that Ramnath was held guilty under Section 302, while the other appellants were held guilty under Section 302 read with Section 34, I. P.

It was said that the testimony of Nanha even to the limited extent to which the learned trial judge found it acceptable was not worthy of reliance and that it was introduced with the object of showing that the shots had been fired by Ramnath and that his description of what happened emanated from his imagination. As regards Ramswarup, it was said that his testimony was equally unsatisfactory. Although in examination-in-chief the witness affirmed that he saw Ramnath shooting Sunder from the front with a pistol and that Purshotham was behind him, he admitted in cross-examination that he had not recognised these two appellants on that occasion. The firing was not, as stated by him, frontal.

He replied that he was returning after the meeting from the Nakalganj and that he was treacherously shot by Mama. I said who else was with Mama. He replied that the accused Purshotham, Pratap and Hanna were also with Mama.\"\\nIn cross-examination he admitted having made the statement, Ex. D-20-B, before the police.

He  had injuries on his chest, abdomen  and  on  the buttock and was bleeding from the injuries. His clothes were bloodstained with blood from his injuries.  He was however in his senses. I asked him what happened.   He said that Pratap, Purushotham, Mamaji and Hanna had \\'jointly shot him with pistol\\'.\"\\nUmashankar, P. W. 30, also gave evidence about this   declaration.   The   learned   sessions   Judge accepted this evidence.  It was corroborated by the first information made by Mulchand to the police the same night.  In the first information report  there  is  a  post-script  after  the words \"Same is correctly recorded\", in these terms:\\n\"Sunder had stated on seeing, by means of a torch that all the four individuals were seen,\"\\nIt was contended by Dr. Tek Chand that this sentence was a subsequent interpolation in the report and that there was no satisfactory evidence that Sunder was in possession of a torch at the time that he was fired at. This torch was not found on the spot or produced before the police on the 6th night or the 7th morning. It was only on the 10th that Munde gave it to the police by saying that it had been given to him by some person who was not produced as a witness. Dr. Tek Chand argued that the incident took place at about 11-30 p. m. on a dark and cloudy night and that the firing was sudden and that in this situation it was not likely that Sunder identified his assailants, particularly when the shots were not being fired from the front.\\nThe learned counsel argued that the story of the torch had been introduced in the case in order to make out that Sunder had some means by which he could identify his assailants on a dark night. Though the learned sessions judge had placed reliance on the testimony of Mulchand, the High Court did not attach any particular value to his evidence in view of the dying declaration, recorded by the magistrate. As already said above, a dying declaration was recorded by the magistrate at the hospital at 12-15 A. M. and it is on this dying declaration that the High Court placed considerable reliance.'}", "subPara": "{}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'16': 'After hearing Dr. Tek Chand for the appellants and Mr. Mehta for the State Government, we have reached the conclusion that in view of the sudden firing that took place at that hour of the night it was not possible for Sunder to clearly identify the persons who had fired the shots at him, that in all likelihood the names he mentioned at the time were the result of the reaction on his mind on the occasion. He thought he must have been fired upon by his arch enemies, he cursed them and exclaimed that after all they had succeeded in finishing him. The dying declaration relied upon by the High Court and recorded by the magistrate on 7th April at 12-15 a. m. does not seem to us to contain a truthful version of what actually happened.\\nWhat is stated there is what Sunder imagined had happened. The first question put to him was: \"Who assaulted you?\". The answer was \"Purshotham, Pratap, Mamaji and Hanna Ahir shot me by means of a pistol\". It is difficult to conceive how four persons could shoot him by means of a single pistol and how he could have actually seen the persons who fired at him with a single pistol. The magistrate in his evidence made it clear that it was \"a pistol\" with which these four persons were stated to have fired at Sunder. Mr. Mehta for the State Government attempted to argue that what Sunder was really stating was that each of these four persons had a pistol and four shots were fired at him from four different pistols.\\nThis argument cannot be seriously considered in view of the injuries on the person of Sunder. It is quite contrary to the case as set out by the prosecution in court. Sunder seems to have made this vague statement because he had not in fact seen who had fired at him. He merely thought that nobody else but these four persons could have fired at him and he therefore made this statement in the vague form in which it is recorded. The answer to the second question put to him cuts at the very root of the prosecution case. The question was: \"Where were you going?\". The answer was:\\n\"Pratap had called and   had   taken   me   toNakalganj, and struck me on bringing me, infront of the chudiwala.\"\\nThis answer suggests that Pratap, appellant, took him to Nakal Ganj and Struck him in front of the chudiwala, i.e., at the place where the occurrence took place. As we have already said, this is wholly contrary to the story of the prosecution and the case that it set out to prove. The High Court thought that Sunder made some mistake in answering this question. There is no warrant for such a suggestion. In the caseof a dying declaration where the exact words stated by a deceased matter and are of importance, a suggestion of the kind that the deceasedmight have said something by a mistake cannot be entertained.\\nThe third question was: \"Who were there \", and the answer was: \"I flashed the torch. All the four individuals were standing.\" This answer seems to have been given in order to make out that he really was able to see his assailants, This answer does not carry conviction in view of the circumstances of the case. It is in evidence that five or six persons were surrounding Sunder when he was answering the questions and the answers seem to be the result of declarations and advice of those persons and given under their influence.'}", "subPara": "{}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'17': 'In our judgment, the High Court was in error in basing the conviction of the appellants much on the uncorroborated dying declaration of the deceased recorded by the magistrate and which was not only vague but which admittedly did not at all events represent the whole truth.'}", "subPara": "{}", "blockQuotes": []}, {"mainPara": "{'18': \"The further contention of Dr. Tek Chand that the High Court was in error in holding that the provisions of Section 34 were attracted to the facts of the case is also well founded.

The conclusions of the High Court in para. 53 of its judgment seem to be based more on conjectures than on admissible material. No act or conduct on the part of the accused has been proved from which an inference of a prearranged plan to murder Sunder could be raised.\\nEven if it is held proved that all the appellants were seen at that spot at the time of firing this fact by itself could not be held enough to prove a common intention of the appellants to murder Sunder. It can well be that these four persons were standing together and one of them suddenly seeing Sunder fired at him. This possibility has not been eliminated by any evidence on the record. In such a situation when it would not be known who fired the fatal shot, none of such persons could be convicted of murder under Section 302, I. P. C. It seems to us that in this case the High Court failed to appreciate the true effect of the decision of the Privy Council in--'Mahbub Shah v.

The  procedurefollowed  in  the  case was the warrant\\t procedure  and\\t theprosecution examined 40 witnesses in593all  before closing its case.  The  examination-in-chief  ofall these witnesses was finished on the 21st November, 1949,and the appellant at that stage, chose to cross-examine onlyone  witness, namely, the fortieth or the last one and\\tthiswas  done  on the 22nd November, 1949.\\t On  29th  November,1949,  the  accused was examined under section\\t273  of\\t theHyderabad  Criminal  Procedure\\tCode  which  corresponds  tosection\\t 342 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code,  and  onthe  5th of December following, charges were framed  againsthim  under sections 123, 124, 330 and 177 read with  section66  of the Hyderabad Penal Code The cross examination of  18prosecution  witnesses\\twas  finished  before  the  26th  ofJanuary,  1950,\\t and the rest of the witnesses\\twere  cross-examined  after that date.  The accused was  examined  againon, 26th February, 1950.\\nBy their judgment dated the 11th September 1950, the SpecialTribunal   convicted  the  appellant  on  all  the   chargesmentioned  above  and  sentenced him to\\t 2  years\"  rigorousimprisonment  under  each of the sections 123, 124  and\\t 177read  with section 66 and to 7 years\\' rigorous\\timprisonmentunder section 330, the sentences to run concurrently.  Therewas  an appeal taken by the appellant against this  decisionto  the\\t High  Court of Hyderabad.  The High  Court  by\\t itsjudgment  dated the 13th of April, 1951, allowed the  appealto  this extent only, namely, that it acquitted the  accusedof  the charge under section 123 of the Hyderabad Code,\\t butotherwise  dismissed the appeal and affirmed the  convictionand  sentence  passed by the Special Tribunal.\\tOn,  6th  ofAugust,\\t 1951, the High Court gave leave to the\\t accused  toappeal\\tto  this  court under articles 132 and\\t134  of\\t theConstitution; and an appeal has been  filed in pursuance  ofthis  certificate.  The records of the appeal have not\\tbeenprinted as yet, but in the mean time the appellant presentedan application under article 32 of the Constitution  prayingfor  a\\twrit in the nature of certiorari  for  quashing\\t theorders of the High Court as well as of the Special Tribunal594referred to `above and for releasing him on the ground\\tthatthe  proceedings  before the Special  Tribunal\\tbecame\\tvoidafter  26th  of January, 1950, as they conflicted  with\\t theprovisions  of articles 14 and 21 of the  Constitution.\\t  Asthe  trial became bad in law after 26th January,  1950,\\t theresulting conviction and sentence were, it is said,  illegalalso, and the appellant is entitled to be released from\\t hisimprisonment \\'When  this  petition  came up for hearing,  a  question\\t wasraised\\tby  the learned Advocate-General for  the  State  ofHyderabad as to whether a petition under article 32 would bethe  proper remedy in a case like this having regard to\\t thefact  that the High Court, which was a properly\\t constitutedcourt  and  was\\t competent  to\\tgo  into  the  question\\t  ofjurisdiction of the Special Tribunal, had already dealt withthis matter.  Without expressing any opinion on this  point,we  decided  to\\t hear  arguments  on  the  questions  raisedtreating  them as preliminary points in the  appeal  itself.Whether the appeal will- be heard further on its merits willdepend\\tupon  the  decision  we arrive\\tat  in\\tthe  presenthearing.\\nThe  contention of Mr. Peerbhoy, who appeared in support  ofthe  appeal, mainly is that the procedure laid down in\\tthe,Special\\t Tribunal Regulation for trial of offences  departs,in  material particulars, from that under the  ordinary\\t lawobtaining in Hyderabad and these differences do abridge\\t therights of the accused and deprive them of benefits to  whichotherwise  they would have been entitled under\\tthe  generallaw.  Prima facie, therefore, the procedure for trial  underthe  Special Tribunal Regulation is discriminatory.   It  isurged that this discrimination could not be justified on anyreasonable\\'principle  of  classification.  No  attempt\\twas,made in the Regulation to classify the offences either\\twithregard\\tto  their  nature or the area  in  which  they\\twerecommitted.   An\\t unfettered  discretion\\t was  left  to\\t theMilitary Governor to refer any and every case as he liked tobe  tried  by.\\tthe Special Tribunal  without  any  rule  orprinciple to595guide  his discretion.\\tThe whole procedure, therefor,e\\t wasvoid  according to the \\' principles laid down by this  courtin  the\\t case  of  Anwar Ali Sarkar v.\\tThe  State  of\\tWestBengal(1).   It is true that in this case  the\\tConstitutionhad  not come into force when the trial was commenced and  aportion of the trial had already been gone through prior  tothe  26th  of  January, 1950; but it is urged  that  as\\t thecontinuance  of\\t the procedure became void on and  from\\t thedate  of  the  Constitution,  the  conviction  and  sentenceresulting  from the adoption of such procedure could not  beupheld.\\t  In this connection, reliance has been placed\\tuponthe  case  of  Lachmandas Kewalram Ahuja  v.  The  State  ofBombay(2)  decided by this court which the  learned  counselcontends exactly covers the present point.The  questions\\traised are undoubtedly\\timportant  and\\ttheyinvolve an examination of some of the earlier pronouncementsof this court.\\nThe  first  question that requires consideration  is  as  towhether\\t the procedure for trial of criminal  offences\\tlaiddown in the Special Tribunal Regulation is discriminatory inits  character and offends against the provision of  article14  of\\tthe Constitution ? If it is found that some  of\\t theprovisions  at least are discriminatory, the question  wouldthen  arise  as to what exactly is the legal position  in  acase  like this where admittedly a considerable\\t portion  ofthe trial was gone through prior to the coming into force ofthe  Constitution and that portion is immune from  challengeon  the ground of discrimination, as the  rights  guaranteedunder  the  Constitution  are  not  retrospective  in  theiroperation.  If the procedure subsequently followed was\\talsodiscriminatory,\\t it is not disputed that the  conviction  ofthe accused could not stand.  But if it is found that  therewas  no occasion after the 26th of January, 1950,  to  applyany   of  the  provisions  of  the  Regulation\\t which\\t arediscriminatory in their character and if as a matter of factthe procedure that was actually followed was substantially(1) [1952] S.C.R. 284.', '2': 'Serial  No.1  mentioned the offence\\t of  murder  of\\t oneShoebulla.

Similar sentences were passed against the co-accused.   Their convictions and sentences we Ire upheld  onappeal\\tby the High Court at Hyderabad on, April  13,  1951.In August, 1951, they obtained leave to appeal to this courtunder articles 132 and 134 of the Constitution.   While  these appeals were pending and the record was\\t incourse of preparation, Razvi filed a petition under  article32  of the Constitution praying for the issue of a  writ  ofcertiorari  calling  for the record of the  High  Court\\t andquashing the orders dated September 11, 1950, and April\\t 13,1951,  and  ordering his release.  The\\tpetition  challengesRegulation V of 1358-Fasli, as having become void after\\t the26th  of  January, 1950, as the procedure laid down  by\\t theRegulation  is\\tdiscriminatory against\\tthe  petitioner\\t andviolates  his  fundamental  right under article\\t 14  of\\t theConstitution.  The petition also challenges the continuationof the trial of the petitioner under the provisions of,\\t thesaid Regulation after the 26th of January, 1950, as being aninfringement  of his rights under articles 14 and 21 of\\t theConstitution.  The conviction and sentence are sought to  beset627aside  as  being  illegal and  without\\tjurisdiction.\\tThiscontention is also raised in the appeal but as the appeal isnot ready, we were invited by Mr. Peerbhoy, counsel for\\t thepetitioner,  to decide the question of the validity  of\\t theimpugned Regulation without waiting for the printing of\\t therecord.\\t  Accordingly  we decided to hear  the\\tquestion  ofjurisdiction as a preliminary point in the appeal.  Mr. Peerbhoy counsel for the petitioner, before giving usa  detailed  list  of the  discriminatory  features  in\\t theimpugned Regulation attacked the Regulation as being withouta preamble specifying the objects of the Regulation such  aspromotion  of  speedy trial, maintenance  of  public  order,safety\\tof  the State etc. which form a\\t common\\t feature  ofSecurity  Acts\\tand Regulations.  This defect  need  not  befatal,\\tfor  it\\t is possible to gather\\tthe  object  of\\t theRegulation  from its provisions considered in the  light  ofthe  surrounding circumstances.\\t There is little doubt\\tthatin view of the disturbed conditions prevailing in the  Stateat  the\\t time, the commission of numerous offences  and\\t thethreat\\tto  commit further acts of  violence,  the  MilitaryGovernor may well have been advised to simplify and  shortenthe procedure for trial of offenders so as to bring them  tospeedy\\tjustice.   The\\tappointment  of\\t Special  Judges  orSpecial Tribunals was conceived in the same spirit, i.e., toexpedite the disposal of cases, so that justice may not bedelayed.\\nBy  section 3 of the Regulation it was provided that\\ttheMilitary  Governor \" may by general or special order  directthat  the  special Tribunal shall try  any  offence  whethercommitted   before   or\\t After\\t the-commencement   of\\t theRegulation,  or\\t any class of offences and may by  any\\tsuchorder  direct  the  transfer to a special  Tribunal  of\\t anyparticular  case  from any other - special Tribunal  or\\t anyother  Criminal Court or direct the transfer from a  specialTribunal  of  any  particular case  to\\tany  other  CriminalCourt.\\'\\t  It  is  contended  not  without  force   that\\t  nonotification was issued in pursuance of section 3 as to whatoffence or628class  of  offences  shall be tried by\\tthe  Tribunal.\\t Thepetitioner,It  is urged, would have  had,no grievance  if  acertain, class of offences in the State or in any particularportion\\t thereof, committed by all and sundry, were  with  aview  to expeditious disposal tried by a  Special  Tribunal,but the perticular case of the petitioner was alone  singledout  for trial by the Special Tribunal, while all  offences,irrespective  of  their\\t nature\\t or  gravity  committed\\t  inBibinagar village before or after the occurrence, were triedin  the ordinary courts according to the  normal  procedure,laid  down in the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code.   Therewas  no\\t basis,\\t much  less  any  rational  basis  for\\t theexceptional  treatment.\\t The trial of the petitioner by\\t theTribunal,  according  to a special procedure,  was,  it\\t wascontended,  discriminatory,  and  took\\taway  his  right  ofequality  before the law.  It is further objected  that\\t theRegulation  prescribed no qualifications for the me  membersof  the\\t Tribunal  and their appointment  was  left  to\\t theunfettered   discretion\\t of  the  Military   Governor.\\t  Noprocedure  requiring any academic qualifications  and  legaltraining has been referred to and this point may be regardedas unsubstantial.  The Tribunal constitute for the trial  ofthe  present case may not perhaps be open to  the  criticismthat  fit and proper persons were not appointed\\t except\\t thefact  that  the\\t President  was\\t not  acquainted  with\\t thelanguage  of the accused, but there was nothing\\t to  preventthe  Military  Governor from appointing any one\\t who  lackedproper\\tqualifications.\\t  His power of appointment  was\\t notcircumscribed by any restrictions and it would be Po  answerto say that he did not abuse this power.', 'Mr': 'Peerbhoy\\t attacked the following provisions  of\\ttheRegulation as discriminatory.', 'b': 'in the case of life imprisonment, by the\\t Governmentand', '13': \"I  do\\tnot think that the  discriminatory  provisions\\tareseverable  from\\t the rest of the Regulation.  Indeed  it  isdoubtful   whether   the  Military   Governor\\twould\\thavepromulgated  the Regulation in the truncated form  if  theseprovisions  are\\t taken\\tout.  For us to do so  would  be  toassume the power to legislate and to frame a new  Regulationin  place of the one promulgated by the\\t Military  Governor.Having\\tregard\\tto  the scheme and  objects  underlying\\t theRegulation,  a\\tseverance of the  discriminatory  provisionswould  affect the integrity of the Regulation  itself.\\t Theobject\\t of  expediting the trial will be  defeated  if\\t thediscriminatory\\tprovisions are eliminated.

Aretrial thereupon was ordered.\\tMr. Justice Das examined theprovisions of the Act in detail, summarising the position atpage 726 as follows:-\\n\"Thus\\t besides  providing  for  enhanced  punishment\\tandwhipping  the  Act  eliminates\\tthe  committal\\t proceedings(section 13 (1)), permits the Special Judge to record only amemorandum of the evidence, confers on him a larger power torefuse to summon a defence witness than what is conferred ona court by section 257 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedureand  also deprives the accused of his right to apply  for  atransfer  or for revision.  That these departures  from\\t theordinary  law  cause prejudice to persons subjected  to\\t theprocedure  prescribed  by  the Act cannot for  a  moment  bedenied.\\t  This court has, by its decisions in the  State  ofWest Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar(1) and in Kathi Raning Rawatv.  The State of Saurashtra (2), recognized that article  14condemns  discrimination not only by a substantive  law\\t butalso by a law of procedure and that the procedure prescribedby  the corresponding provisions in the West Bengal  SpecialCourts\\tAct  and the Saurashtra Ordinance  which  introducedsimilar\\t departures  from  the\\tordinary  law  of  procedureconstituted(1) [1952] S.C.R. 284.\\t (2) (1952) S.C.R. 435.\\na discrimination against persons tried by the Special  Judgeaccording  to  procedure  prescribed  -by  those  pieces  oflegislation and finally that, in any event, section 5 (1) ofthe  West  Bengal  Act and section  11\\tof  the\\t Saurashtra,Ordinance,  both of which corresponded to section 12 of\\t theBombay\\tPublic\\tSecurity  Measures Act, in so  far  as\\ttheyauthorised the Government to direct specific and  particular\\'cases\\'\\t  to   be   tried  by\\tthe   Special\\tJudge,\\t wasunconstitutional  and void.  In view of the departures\\tfromthe  ordinary law brought about by the Bombay Public  SafetyMeasures Act, 1947, which are noted above, it cannot but  beheld, on a parity of reasoning, that at any rate section  12of  the\\t Act, in so far as it authorises the  Government  todirect particular \\'cases\\' to be tried by a Special Judge, isalso unconstitutional.\"\\nDealing  with\\tthe  argument that  the\\t special  procedureprescribed by the impugned Act constitutes a departure\\tfromthe  ordinary law of procedure and is, in some\\t,  importantrespects,  detrimental\\tto  the\\t interest  of  the   personssubjected to it and as such is discriminatory he observed:-  \"The\\tdiscrimination\\tdoes  not end with  the\\t taking\\t ofcognizance of the case by the Special Judge without the casebeing  committed  to him but continues\\teven  in  subsequentstages of the proceedings in that the person subjected to itcannot, even at those subsequent stages, have the benefit ofhaving the evidence for or against him recorded in  extenso,may  not get summons for all witnesses he wishes to  examinein  defence only on the ground that the Special\\t Judge\\tdoesnot consider that such evidence will be material and  cannotexercise his right to apply to a superior court for transferof  the\\t case even though the Special  Judge  has  exhibitedgross bias against him or to apply for revision of any ordermade  by  the Special Judge.  As the Act was  valid  in\\t itsentirety  before the date of the Constitution, that part  ofthe  proceeding before the Special Judge, which, up to\\tthatdate, had been regulated by this special procedure cannot bequestioned, however discriminatory it may636have been, but if the discriminatory procedure is  continuedafter  the  date  of the Constitution,\\tsurely\\tthe  accusedperson\\tmay legitimately ask: Why am I to-day being  treateddifferently  from other persons accused of similar  offencesin respect of procedure ?\"\\nAfter holding that there was no nexus which connected thebasis on which the supposed classification was founded\\twiththe objects of the Act he went on to observe :- \"In the absence of a rational basis of classification,\\t asexplained  above, there can be no justification,  after\\t theadvent of the Constitution, for depriving the appellants  ofthe right to move the Court for transfer or for revision  orto obtain process for the attendance of defence witnesses orof  having the evidence of the witnesses recorded as  in  anordinary trial \\'Which is available to other persons  accusedof similar offences and prosecuted according to the ordinaryprocedure  laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\t  Itis,  therefore, clear that in this case\\t the  discriminationcontinued  after the Constitution came into force  and\\tsuchcontinuation  of  the  application  of\\tthe   discriminatoryprocedure to their cases after the date of the\\tConstitutionconstituted  a breach of their fundamental right  guaranteedby article 14 and being inconsistent with the provisions  ofthat article the special procedure became void under article13  and as there is no vested right or liability in  mattersof  procedure,\\tthe  appellants are  entitled  to  be  triedaccording  to the ordinary procedure after the date  of\\t theConstitution.  Their complaint is not for something that hadhappened  before 26th January, 1950, but is for\\t unconstitu-tional discrimination shown against them since that date.  Indeed  in a sense the Special Judge\\'s jurisdiction  cameto an end, for he was enjoined to proceed only according  tothe  special  procedure, and that procedure,  having  becomevoid as stated I above he could not637proceed\\t at  all as a Judge of a Special  Court\\t constitutedunder the impugned Act....... The point for decision now  iswhether the continuation of -the procedure by the Act  afterthe  Constitution came into force operates to the  prejudiceof the appellants and, as such, offends against their  newlyacquired  fundamental  right  of  equal\\t protection  of\\t lawguaranteed   by\\t article  14.\\tThe  Constitution   has\\t  noretrospective  operation  to  invalidate that  part  of\\t theproceedings  that  has\\talready been gone  through  but\\t theConstitution does not permit the special procedure to  standin  the\\t way  of the exercise  or  enjoyment  of  post-cons-titutional  rights  and\\t must, therefore,  strike  down\\t thediscriminatory procedure if it is sought to be adopted afterthe Constitution came into operation.\"\\nThe view taken by my Lord the Chief Justice was that\\ttheprovisions  of\\tthe  Constitution  relating  to\\t fundamentalrights\\thave no retrospective operation and, do\\t not  affectthe  criminal prosecution commenced before the\\tConstitutioncame into: force even though section 12 of the Bombay Act isheld to be discriminatory and void.\\nI  have given not without reluctance\\tcopious\\t quotationsfrom the majority judgment because its meaning has been\\t thesubject\\t of much controversy before us.\\t While on\\'  the\\t onehand,  Mr. Peerbhoy contends that the Act was  condemned  asbad by the majority because of the discriminatory provisionsappearing  on the face of it and the question  whether\\tsuchprovisions were applied in fact to the accused of that\\tcaseafter  the  coming  into  force\\t of  the  Constitution\\t wasconsidered entirely irrelevant the learned  Advocate-Generalurges that the court did not apply its mind to the  questionwhether\\t the  Act  should be declared  void  even  when\\t thediscriminatory provisions are not applied.  The whole  trendand  the reasoning of the judgment to my mind point to.\\t theconclusion  that the court did not consider it necessary  togo  into the question whether the discriminatory  provisionswere  applied  as th at question was irrelevant in  view  oftheir finding that the Act became638void after the coming into force of the Constitution on\\t thesimple ground that it contained discriminatory provisions onthe  face of it-.  There were four identical features  whichare  common  in the two cases, namely absence  of  committalproceedings,  power  to\\t record only  a\\t memorandum  of\\t theevidence,  absence of a right to apply for transfer  or\\t forrevision.  It is not easy to see how the right to apply\\t fora  transfer  or for revision could be  exercised  under\\t theRegulation after the 26th of January.  During the course  ofcross-examination of 22 witnesses if the Tribunal  overruledthe  objection of the accused or passed any  adverse  order,the  accused could not challenge it by way of revision,\\t norif  it\\tshowed any bias in the recording  of  the  evidence,could  the  accused  apply for transfer.   Indeed  there  isevidence  that\\tan order of the Tribunal dated the  15th  ofDecember,  1949, was carried in revision to the High  Court,but  the revision was dismissed on February 27,\\t 1950.\\t Theoffice, it appears, noted that under section 7, clause 2  ofthe  Regulation\\t there\\tcould not be any  revision  but\\t thelearned\\t Chief\\tJustice in rejecting the  revision  petitionmerely\\tsaid  that be saw no reason to\\tinterfere  \"at\\tthisstage\".\\t  I do not think that the order of  rejection  meantthat the stage of interference was not appropriate and\\tthathe  would have the right to interfere at a later stage,\\t sayat the time of the appeal.  The learned Chief Justice  couldnot  have  been\\t unaware of the fact that  no  revision\\t wascompetent  against  an\\torder  of  the\\tTribunal  under\\t theRegulation.   It is significant that this order\\t was  passedafter the coming into force of the Constitution.   Similarlyif  the\\t accused  had  asked  for  bail,  and  it  had\\tbeenrefused,he could    not have been able successfully to\\tmovethe High  Court in revision against the order of refusal. Itis  obvious therefore that just as in Lachmandas\\'s case\\t (1)the  procedure under the Regulation could not  be  continuedwithout\\t eliminating the right to apply for transfer or\\t forrevision, in the same(1)  [1952] S.C.R. 284.\\nway  the  trial of the petitioner could not  go\\t on  withoutthese  discriminatory provisions after the 26th of  January.Again  the right to confirmation of the sentences passed  bythe Tribunal could not be given effect to as the  Regulationdefinitely  negatived such a right.  Whether in\\t the  eventsthat happened the question of confirmation did not arise  isbesides the point.  It could well have arisen if a  sentenceexceeding ten years bad been passed by the Tribunal.  I\\t cansee no real ground for any distinction between\\tLachmandas\\'scase(1)\\t and  the  present case.  My  learned  brothers\\t arecertainly in a better position to interpret the decision  inLachmandas\\'s case (1) and to say whether their intention wasnot   to   declare  the\\t Act  bad,  whether   or   not\\t itsdiscriminatory\\tprovisions  were  applied in  fact.   It  isimpossible for me to go behind the actual words used in\\t thedecision  and  my  conclusion is  based\\t entirely  upon\\t thelanguage and the reasoning adopted in that case. The  conclusion  I  have arrived at is\\t fortified  by\\ttheobservations of Mr. Justice Mukherjes in Anwar Ali  Sarkar\\'scase(\"), at page 331, \" but when the statute itself makes  adiscrimination\\twithout any proper or reasonable basis,\\t thestatute would be invalidated for being in conflict with\\t theequal  protection clause, and the question as to how  it  isactually  worked out may not necessarily be a material\\tfactfor consideration.\" My learned brother Mr. Justice  Chandra-sekhara\\t Aiyar\\talso  emphasised in that  case\\t\"  that\\t thequestion  which falls to be considered under article  14  iswhether the legislation is discriminatory in its nature\\t andthis  has  to be determined not so much by  its\\t purpose  orobjects but by its effects\" (page 349).\\nIt will be convenient to refer to the West Bengal  case(\")at  this stage.\\t In this case the accused who  were  chargedwith various offences committed by them in the course of  anarmed  raid on the Jessop Factory at Dum Dum were  convictedby a Special Court appointed under section 5 (1) of the WestBengal(1) [1952] S.C.R. 710.\\t (2) [1952] S.C.R. 284.\\nSpecial\\t Courts\\t Act No. X of 1950.  The Full Bench  of\\t theCalcutta  High\\tCourt which was moved by the  accused  underarticle\\t 226 for the issue of a writ of certiorari to  quashthe conviction and the sentence held that the Special  Courthad no jurisdiction to try the case, as section 5 (1) of theAct  was void under article 32, as it denied to the  accusedthe equal protection of the laws enjoined by article 14.  Onappeal\\tby the State the majority of six learned  Judges  ofthis  court  upheld  the view, my  Lord\\t the  Chief  Justicedissenting.    The  observations  of  the   learned   Judgesconstituting   the  majority  deal  effectively\\t  with\\t thecontentions  raised  in\\t the present case and  may  best  bereproduced in their own words:-\\n\" Mahajan J -That the Special Act lays down  substantiallydifferent  rules for trial of offences and cases  than\\tlaiddown  in  the  general law of the land, i.e.,  the  Code  ofCriminal  Procedure, cannot be seriously denied.  It  short-circuits that procedure in material particulars.......... Not  only  does  the  special\\tlaw  deprive  them  of\\tthesafeguard  of the committal procedure and of the trial\\twiththe help of jury or assessors, but it also deprives them  ofthe  right of a de novo trial in case of transfer and  makesthem liable for conviction and punishment for major offencesother  than  those for which they may have been\\t charged  ortried.......  To a certain extent the \\'remedies to which  anaccused person is entitled for redress in the higher  courtshave been cut down.  Even if it be said that the statute  onthe face of it is not discriminatory, it is so in its effectand  operation,\\t inasmuch  as  it  vests  in  the  executivegovernment  unregulated official discretion,  and  thereforehas to be adjudged unconstitutional.\"\\n`` Mukherjea J.-I agree with the Attorney-General that\\t ifthe  differences  are  not material, there may\\tnot  be\\t anydiscrimination\\tin  the proper sense of the word  and  minordeviations  from  the general standard might not  amount  todenial of equal rights.\\t I find641it  difficult, however, to hold that the difference in\\ttheprocedure  that\\t has  been introduced  by  the\\tWest  BengalSpecial Courts Act is of a minor or unsubstantial  characterwhich has not - prejudiced the interest of the accused.  The first difference is that made in section 6 of the Actwhich  lays down that the Special Court may take  cognizanceof an offence without the accused being committed to it\\t fortrial,\\tand that in trying the accused it has to follow\\t theprocedure for trial) of warrant cases by Magistrates.  It isurged  by the Attorney-General that the elimination  of\\t thecommittal proceedings is a matter of no importance and\\tthatthe  warrant procedure, which the Special Court has  got  tofollow,\\t affords a scope f or a. preliminary examination  ofthe  evidence  against\\tthe  accused  before  a\\t charge\\t  isframed.......\\nUnder section 350 of the Criminal Procedure Code, when acase  after  being heard in part goes  for  disposal  beforeanother\\t Magistrate,  the accused has the right\\t to  demand,before the second Magistrate commences the proceedings, thatthe witnesses already examined should be re-examined and re-heard.\\t This right has been taken away from the accused  incases *here a case is transferred from one Special Court  toanother\\t under\\tthe provision of section 7  of\\tthe  SpecialCourts Act.  Further the right of revision to the High Courtdoes not exist at all under the new procedure, although\\t therights under the Constitution of India are retained.  It hasbeen pointed out and quite  correctly by one of the  learnedcounsel for respondents that an application for bail  cannotbe made before the High Court on behalf of an accused  afterthe  Special  Court  has  refused  bail.   These  and  otherprovisions  of the Act make it clear that the rights of\\t theaccused\\t have been curtailed in a substantial manner by\\t theimpugned legislation ; and if the rights are curtailed\\tonlyin  certain  cases  and\\t not  in  others,  even\\t though\\t thecircumstances\\tin   the  latter  cases.,  are\\t the   same,&,,question of discrimination may certainly arise.......  AsI have said already642in the present case the discrimination &rises on the  termsof  the\\t Act itself.  The fact that  it\\t gives\\tunrestrainedpower to the State Government to select in any way it  likesthe  particular\\t cases\\tor offences which  should  go  to  aSpecial\\t Tribunal and withdraw in such cases the  protectionwhich  the accused normally enjoy under the criminal law  ofthe country, is on the face of it discriminatory.\" \"Das  J.-The elimination of the committal proceedings\\tandof  trial by jury (section 6), the taking away of the  rightto  a de novo trial on transfer (section 7), the vesting  ofdiscretion  in\\tthe Special Court to  refuse to )  summon  adefence\\t witness if it be satisfied that his  evidence\\twillnot  be material (section 8), the liability to be  convictedof  an\\toffence higher than that for which the\\taccused\\t wassent up for trial under the Act (section 13), the  exclusionof  interference  of  other-courts by  way  of\\trevision  ortransfer  or under section 491 of the Code (section 16)\\t &resome of the glaring instances of inequality brought about bythe impugned Act.\\n\"   Chandrasekhara  Aiyar  J.-Preliminary   inquiry   beforecommittal to the sessions, trial by jury or with the aid  ofassessors,  the\\t right of a de novo trial on transfer  of  acase  from one court to another, have been taken  away\\tfromthe accused who are to be tried by a Special Court.\" \"Bose J.-We find men accused of heinous crimes called uponto  answer  for\\t their lives and liberties.

Under Section 34 of the Act he was916not  competent to dispose his property by will\\twithout\\t theconsent\\t in writing of the Court of Wards, though  prior  tothe 1st August, 1901, he had made four successive wills, thelast  being dated 19th June, 1901, under which he  gave\\t hisestate absolutely to his wife.\\tOn the 30th November,  1901,he  made a will giving a life interest to his wife  and\\t theremainder over to his cousin Ganga Bux Singh after providingfor certain legacies by way of maintenance in favour of\\t histhree  daughters, his father\\'s sister and his  mother.\\t TheCourt of Wards withheld its consent to this will which\\tthusfell  through.\\t On the 7th January, 1904, Ganga  Bux  Singhexecuted  in  his  favour a  registered\\t deed  of  agreementagreeing  to  pay him Rs. 50 per month during  his  lifetimewith effect from the month in which he would execute a\\twillin  favour  of Ganga Bux Singh and his sons and\\t submit\\t thesame for sanction of the Members of the Board of Revenue.  Adraft  of  the will was accordingly prepared by him  on\\t the18th  January, 1904, under which he gave a life interest  tohis wife and the residue of the property to Ganga Bux  Singhand  after  him\\t to his sons after  providing  legacies\\t formaintenance in favour of his daughters, father\\'s sister\\t andmother.\\t  The  Board of Revenue intimated on the  25th\\tMay,1904,  that  it\\t would not withhold its consent\\t to  a\\twillsimilar\\t to that contained in the draft but altered  in\\t thelight of the proposals contained in the further letter dated27th  April, 1904.  He thereupon duly made and\\tpublished  awill  on  the  28th  July,  1904,  in  accordance  with\\t thesuggestions contained in the Board\\'s letter dated 25th\\tMay,1904, cancelling all the previous wills executed by him.  Itappears\\t that  he handed over the original of this  will  toGanga  Bux  Singh  but did not give any\\t intimation  of\\t theexecution  thereof  to the authorities and  the\\t authoritiescould  only  come to know of the same when Ganga  Bux  Singhgave  the original will to the Special Manager on  or  aboutthe  19th  December, 1905.  He appears to have\\tchanged\\t hismind thereafter and having embraced Christianity intended tomarry a Christian woman and submitted to the Court of  Wardson the 8th June, 1906, the draft of a new will which he917intended  to execute in favour of his Christian\\t wife.\\t TheBoard withheld its consent to that new will and intimated onthe  13th  July,  1906, its refusal  and  also\\tcommunicatedthereby\\t the withholding of its consent to the will  alreadyexecuted  by him on the 28th July, 1904.  A further  attemptby him on the 21st November, 1906, to obtain the consent  ofthe   Court  of\\t Wards\\tto  another  draft  will  was\\talsounsuccessful and the will dated the 28th July, 1904, was theonly  last  will  and  testament executed  by  him  and\\t gotregistered after consent obtained from the Court of Wards.Shankar\\t Bux Singh died thereafter on the 28th\\tJuly,  1922,and  he\\t being\\ta  Christian  at  the  time  of\\t his   deathsuccesssion  to\\t his  property was governed  by\\t the  IndianSuccession  Act.  His wife got 1/3rd of the estate  and\\t theremaining  2/3rds were divided in equal shares\\tbetween\\t hissurviving daughter and the son of a predeceased daughter  ofhis.  Mutation was effected in the records of rights and thename  of  the  widow was .shown there as the  owner  of\\t theestate\\tin  his\\t place\\tand  stead.   The  Court  of   Wardsrelinquished  charge  of the estate  sometime  in  November,1925.\\tThe widow executed on the 16th August, 1927, a\\tdeedof gift conveying the bulk of the estate to her daughter andthe  son  of the predeceased daughter.\\t She  also  executedanother deed of gift in the same year conveying the rest  ofthe  properties\\t and on the 8th September, 1928,  Ganga\\t BuxSingh filed a suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge  ofSitapur for a declaration that under the aforesaid will\\t shehad  only a life interest in the property and the  transfersmade  by her were void.\\t This suit was contested by her\\t andone of the defences taken was that Ganga Bux Singh could notmaintain  the  suit  without  first  obtaining\\tletters\\t  ofadministration\\twith  the will annexed.\\t  This\\tdefence\\t wasupheld and the suit was dismissed on the 14th July, 1930.Ganga  Bux  Singh having died in the meanwhile on  the\\t19thOctober,   1929,   his\\t sons\\tapplied\\t  for\\tletters\\t  ofadministration with the will annexed on the 25th  September,1930, on the original side of the Chief Court of Oudh.\\tThisapplication was opposed by the918widow and other heirs of Shankar Bux Singh inter alia on theground that the will had been executed without the  sanctionof  the\\t Court\\tof Wards.  Mr. Justice\\tKisch  delivered  anelaborate judgment, negatived all the objections and grantedletters of administration with the will annexed to the\\tsonsof  Ganga Bux Singh on the 16th November, 1931.\\t  An  appealfiled  by the widow and heirs of Shankar Bux  Singh  againstthat decision was allowed by the Bench of the Chief Court ofOudh  at Lucknow on the 8th September, 1933, and the  orderspassed by the lower court granting letters of administrationwith the will annexed were set aside.  The sons of Ganga BuxSingh  took  an\\t appeal\\t to  the  Privy\\t Council  and  theirLordships  of  the  Privy  Council on  the  7th\\t May,  1937,reversed  the  decree of the Appeal Court and  restored\\t thedecree passed by Mr. Justice Kisch.  Their Lordships howeverobserved  that\\tthe only effect of their decision  was\\tthatletters\\t of administration with a copy of the  will  annexedmust  be  granted as prayed but that would not\\tin  any\\t wayprejudice  any proceedings against any of the  beneficiarieswhich may be open to the respondents or any of them.On the 9th September, 1937, the widow, the daughter and\\t theson  of the predeceased daughter of Shankar Bux\\t Singh,\\t theplaintiffs, \\'filed the suit out of which this appeal arises,against\\t the three sons of Ganga Bux Singh, the\\t defendants,for  a declaration that the will dated the 28th July,  1904,was  inoperative  and ineffectual and that in any  case\\t thedefendants had no right, title or interest in the propertiesin suit, that plaintiff I was entitled to hold the  propertyin suit under the will of Shankar Bux Singh dated 19th June,1901,  or  that the plaintiffs 1 to 3 were entitled  to\\t thesame as heirs-at-law of Shankar Bux Singh deceased under theprovisions of the Indian Succession Act, and for further andother reliefs.\\tIn the plaint they alleged that the will wasinoperative as Shankar Bux Singh had no animus testandi\\t andthat  it  was  void  and  inoperative  in  respect  of\\t thetestamentary disposition in favour of Ganga919Bux  Singh  and his sons because Ganga Bux Singh  failed  toperform\\t his part of the contract as regards the payment  ofmonthly\\t allowance  and the defendants therefore  could\\t nottake   advantage  of  or  claim\\t any  benefit  tinder\\tthattestamentary disposition and further the payment of the saidallowance being a condition precedent and the condition\\t nothaving\\tbeen fulfilled the disposition\\tbecame\\tinoperative.The  defendant\\t3  filed  a written  statement\\ton  the\\t 7thFebruary,  1938,  contesting  the  plaintiff\\'s\\tclaim.\\t  Hecontended that the plea as to the validity or effect of\\t thewill was barred by resjudicata by virtue of the judgment  ofthe  Privy Council dated 7th May, 1937.\\t He denied that\\t thewill  was  executed in consideration of the  agreement.\\t  Healso  denied  that there was any contingent  or\\t conditionalcontract or any trace of the alleged condition in the  wholeof  the\\t correspondence between Shankar Bux  Singh  and\\t theBoard of Revenue.\\nThe  learned  Civil Judge, Sitapur,  after  considering\\t theevidence,  oral as well as documentary, led before him\\theldthat the will as well as the agreement formed one  contract,that  Ganga Bux Singh had failed to perform his\\t promise  orhis  part  of the contract, that the only  point  which\\t wasagitated before their Lordships of the Privy Council was  asregards the consent of the Court of Wards and that thereforeeven though the plaintiffs were precluded from disputing thegenuineness of the will they were not precluded from seekinga  declaration\\tto the effect that the defendants  were\\t notentitled  to  any  benefit  under the  will,  and  that\\t thedecision therefore did not operate as res judicata so far asissues in the present case were concerned.  He however\\theldthat  the contract clearly provided a remedy for  breach  onthe part of either party, that Shankar Bux Singh did not  infact  cancel the will and could not be said to have  treatedit  as inoperative, that Ganga Bux Singh acquired  a  vestedinterest in the estate on the death of the testator and thaton his death that interest devolved on his sons amongst whomwere  the  defendants in the suit and  that  the  plaintiffswere, not entitled to any relief as claimed, The920plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Chief Court of Oudh.\\t TheChief  Court of Oudh negatived the contention  that  ShankarBux  Singh had no animus testandi and that it was a will  inform  only and not in substance, holding that it was  barredby res judicata by reason of the decision of their Lordshipsof the Privy Council.  It also negatived the contention thatthe  bequest in favour of Ganga Bux Singh was a\\t conditionalbequest or that Ganga Bux Singh having failed to fulfil\\t hisobligation  to\\tpay the gujara his original character  as  alegatee changed into that of a trustee and he must hold\\t thebeneficial  interest  for the testator or  his\\theirs.\\t Theappeal\\twas therefore dismissed with costs.  The  plaintiffsapplied\\t for  leave to appeal to the Privy Council  and\\t thenecessary certificate was granted by the Chief Court of Oudhon the 8th August, 1947.\\nIt  is\\tnecessary  at  the outset to set  out  the  deed  ofagreement  and\\tthe  will executed by Ganga  Bux  Singh\\t andShankar\\t Bux  Singh respectively on dates the  7th  January,1904, and the 28th July, 1904.\\tThe deed of agreement  datedthe 7th January, 1904, ran as under:-\\n\"Whereas, my cousin Thakur Shankar Bakhsh Singh, Taluqdar ofRampur Kalan, has proposed to make a bequest of his  taluka,immovables, movables, rights etc. in favour of his wife and,after her death in my favour and that of my sons Dwarka NathSingh,\\tAjodhya Nath Singh and Tirbhuwan Nath Singh,  there-fore by way of consideration for this concession and favour,I, the executant, out of my own free will do hereby  executethis agreement in favour of my cousin aforesaid that in\\t themonth  in which the said cousin might execute the said\\twillin  my\\tfavour and that of my sons and lays the\\t same  alongwith an application before the Deputy Commissioner,  Sitapurdistrict,  for\\tsanction  of the Members  of  the  Board  ofRevenue,  I shall from the 1st date of the  month  followingthat month, continue to pay to my said cousin Rs. 50 in cashevery  month  during  his life, so long\\t as  the  said\\twillremains\\t in force and under this contract I make  my  personliable and hypothecate the same by virtue921of this agreement.

It was this draft of the\\twillamended as it was by the letter dated 27th April, 1904, thatwas  engrossed in the will which was ultimately executed  onthe  28th July, 1904, after the letter of sanction  obtainedfrom  the Board on 25th May, 1904.  The learned Civil  Judgeunder the circumstances came rightly to the conclusion\\tthatthe  deed of agreement and the will formed part of the\\tsametransaction,  that  the consideration for the will  was\\t thedeed  of agreement and the consideration for  the  agreementwas the will and that the will923as well as the agreement formed one contract.  This  findingwas not challenged before the Chief Court of Oudh and  couldnot  be\\t challenged  before us.\\t There was  also  a  furtherfinding\\t of  fact which was recorded by\\t the  learned  CivilJudge  and it was that Ganga Bux Singh failed and  neglectedto  -make any payment to Shankar Bux Singh in terms  of\\t thedeed of agreement even though Shankar Bux Singh executed thewill and laid the same along with the application before theDeputy Commissioner, Sitapur, for sanction of the Members ofthe Board of Revenue and that Ganga Bux Singh thus failed toperform his part of the contract.  This finding also was notchallenged  before the Chief Court of Oudh and could not  bechallenged before us.\\nThe question therefore which falls to be considered by us iswhat  is the effect of the failure on the part of Ganga\\t BuxSingh to make the payments to Shankar Bux Singh in terms  ofthe  deed of agreement.\\t It was urged by Dr.  Tekchand,\\t whoappeared for the plaintiffs before us that by reason of suchnon-payment and the breach of contract on the part of  GangaBux Singh the will became ineffective and inoperative,\\tthatthe  payment  of  Rs. 50 per month during  the\\tlifetime  ofShankar\\t Bux Singh was a condition precedent to the  vestingof  the\\t legacy\\t in  favour of\\tGanga  Bux  Singh  and\\tthatcondition not having been fulfilled the legacy did not\\tvestin  Ganga Bux Singh and that on a true construction  of\\t theterms  of  the\\twill  Ganga Bux\\t Singh\\tacquired  no  vestedinterest in the remainder.  He also urged that the scope  ofthe  Privy Council judgment was misunderstood by  the  ChiefCourt of Oudh and that both the questions as regards  animustestandi  and  the  payment  of Rs. 50\\tper  month  being  acondition precedent though they were barred by res  judicatain  regard to the due execution of the will were still\\topento  him\\t as affecting the right of Ganga Bux  Singh  to\\t thelegacy which was provided for him by Shankar Bux Singh underthe will.\\nIn regard to the last contention urged by Dr. Tekchand\\tboththe  courts below were of the opinion that the\\tquestion  ofanimus testandi was barred by res924judicata.   It\\twas  held by their Lordships  of  the  PrivyCouncil that the will in dispute was not revoked and that itwas the last will and testament of Shankar Bux Singh.\\tThatdecision  necessarily  meant  that  the\\t testator  when\\t -heappended  his  signature  to the will was  in  a  sound\\t anddisposing state of mind, was a free agent and \\'duly executedthe  will  in  accordance with the law.\\t  The  decision\\t wasconclusive   as\\t regards  the  testamentary  capacity,\\t dueexecution and the representative title of the person to whomthe  letters  of administration with the will  annexed\\tweregranted.   It  was not open therefore to the  plaintiffs  tocontend\\t that  the will which was executed  by\\tShankar\\t BuxSingh  was a will merely in form and not in substance.\\t Thequestion  of  animus testandi was therefore  barred  by\\t resjudicata.   In\\tregard however to the question\\twhether\\t thebequest\\t in favour of Ganga Bux Singh could take  effect  byreason\\tof  default  in payment the decision  of  the  PrivyCouncil\\t did not constitute res judicata and it was open  tothe  plaintiffs to urge that contention.  Both\\tthe  courts\\'below therefore allowed the plaintiffs to agitate that ques-tion  though  they  came  to a\\tconclusion  adverse  to\\t theplaintiffs.  We are of the opinion that there was no bar  ofres judicata and the courts below were right in allowing theplaintiffs to agitate that question.  The payment of Rs.  50per month to Shankar Bux Singh during his lifetime might  bea  condition  precedent\\t to  the  whole\\t will  coming\\tintooperation or might, be a condition precedent to the  vestingof  the\\t legacy\\t in  favour of\\tGanga  Bux  Singh.   If\\t theplaintiffs  urged  the\\tformer\\tposition  that\\tplea   wouldcertainly be barred by res judicata.  No court would grant aprobate\\t or letters of administration with the will  annexedin regard to a will which has ceased to be operative and wasa  mere scrap of paper.\\t The plaintiffs could not  thereforebe heard to say that \\'by reason of the non-fulfilment of thecondition  precedent the whole will had become\\tinoperative,for  that  would run counter to the decision  of  the  PrivyCouncil.  Even on merits such a position would be  untenablefor the simple reason that besides925Ganga  Bux Singh there was the widow, who was given  a\\tlifeinterest  and there were the three daughters,  the  father\\'ssister\\tand  the mother who were given legacies\\t by  way  ofmaintenance  and  they\\twere certainly not  guilty  of\\tnon-fulfilment  of\\tany  condition precedent.   The\\t will  wouldcertainly therefore stand so far as they were concerned\\t andthe  whole  effect of the non-fulfilment  of  the  conditionprecedent  qua\\tGanga  Bux Singh would\\tbe  to\\tprevent\\t thevesting of the legacy in his favour.\\nThe  latter  position therefore would be  available  to\\t theplaintiffs and they could contend that by reason of the non-fulfilment of the condition precedent by Ganga Bux Singh thelegacy\\tprovided in his favour did not vest in him.  If\\t thepayment\\t of  Rs.  50  per  month  therefore  constituted   acondition  precedent the plaintiffs were on firm ground\\t andthat  position could not and was not contested before us  bythe  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  defendants.\\t  Ittherefore  remains to be considered whether the\\t payment  ofRs.  50 pet month to Shankar Bux Singh during  his  lifetimeconstituted  a\\tcondition precedent to the  vesting  of\\t thelegacy in favour of Ganga Bux Singh.\\nThere is no doubt, as held by the learned Civil Judge,\\tthatthe consideration for the will was the deed of agreement andthe  consideration for the agreement was the will  and\\tthatthe will as well as the agreement formed one contract.\\t Butfor  Ganga Bux Singh having executed the deed  of  agreementShankar Bux Singh would not have forwarded the draft will tothe  Court of Wards for its sanction and he would  also\\t nothave executed the will on the 28th July, 1904.\\tThe contractwas an overall contract under which both the parties had  toperform their respective obligations.  The obligation on thepart of Ganga Bux Sigh was to execute the deed of agreement,agreeing  to  pay  the\\tmoneys\\tto  Shankar  Bux  Singh\\t  inaccordance  with the terms thereof.  The obligation  on\\t thepart of Shankar Bux Singh was to execute the will and submitit  to\\tthe  Court of Wards for its  sanction.\\t Both  theseobligations  were  fulfilled  by the  parties  and  the\\t twodocuments were supported by consideration and became binding926on both the parties.  The nonperformance of the agreement topay  by\\t Ganga Bux Singh constituted at best a\\tfailure.  tofulfil his obligation and Shankar Bux Singh became  entitledto pursue his rights and remedies against Ganga Bux Singh byreason of the breach of contract by him.\\nIt  was\\t urged by Dr. Tekchand that the\\t consideration\\thereconstituted  a condition precedent and that the\\t non-paymentof  Rs.\\t 50 per month by Ganga Bux  Singh  constituted\\tnon-fulfilment of condition precedent.\\nHe  relied upon the observations of Chief Justice  Wills  inAcherley  v. Vernon, 125 English Reports 1106 at  page\\t1108(Willes 153 at page 156):\\n\"  I  know  of\\tno  words that either  in  a  will  or\\tdeednecessarily  make a condition precedent, but the same  wordswill  either  make  a  condition  precedent  or\\t  subsequentaccording  to the nature of the thing and the intent of\\t theparties.   If therefore a man devise one thing in  lieu\\t andconsideration  of another, or agree to do anything or pay  asum  of\\t money in consideration of anything to be  done,  inthese  cases that which is the consideration is looked\\tuponas a condition precedent.  So is the case of Peters v. Opie,I Ventr. 177, and I Saund. 350.\\t If a man agree to pay a sumof money to another pro labore suo in pulling down a  house,the pulling down of the house is a condition precedent.\\t  Sois the case of Thorpe and Thorpe.  I Salk. 171, where a\\t managreed\\tto  pay a sum of money to another he  releasing\\t theequity\\tof redemption in certain lands.\\t And so is the\\tcaseof Turner v. Goodwin, adjudged by Lord Macclesfield and\\t therest of the Judges of B. R. upon great consideration, P.  13Anne,  in  which case Goodwin was to pay  Turner  15001.  beassigning a judgment.  In all which cases it was holden thatthe  party who was to receive the money was not entitled  todemand\\tit  until  he  had  performed  that  which  was\\t theconsideration  of the payment, and which was  considered  inall  these cases to be in the nature of a  condition  prece-dent.\\n*\\t\\t      *\\t\\t\\t    *\\t\\t   *927So  likewise  if it plainly appear to be the intent  of\\t thetestator  that the devise shall not have the benefit of\\t thedevise\\tunless he perform a certain act enjoined him by\\t thedevisor,  this\\tis a condition precedent;  and\\tthe  deviseeshall  have  no benefit of the devise until he\\tperform\\t it,even though the condition be never so unreasonable if it  benot  illegal  or  impossible; for cujus est  dare  ejus\\t estdisponere.\"\\nThese  observations  were particularly relied  upon  by\\t Dr.Tekehand  in support of his contention that the\\t payment  ofRs.  50 per month to Shankar Bux Singh during  his  lifetimeconstituted  a\\tcondition precedent to the  vesting  of\\t thelegacy in favour of Ganga Bux Singh.\\nWhile  recognising  the force of these observations  we\\t areconstrained  to\\t observe  that\\tthe terms  of  the  deed  ofagreement  negative  any  such\\tcontention.   The  agreementitself provided what was to happen if payment was not-\\tmadein  accordance with the terms thereof.\\tIf Ganga  Bux  Singhfailed to perform the contract Shankar Bux Singh was to havethe  power  to have the same performed by  Ganga  Bux  Singhthrough\\t Court.\\t This consequence could not be\\tcontemplatedif  the\\t payment constituted a condition precedent  and\\t thenon-fulfilment\\tof the condition precedent was to  have\\t theeffect\\tof  rendering the agreement  inoperative.   In\\tthatevent  the agreement itself would become inoperative and  norights\\tunder  the agreement would survive  to\\tShankar\\t BuxSingh.\\t The right which was therefore given to Shankar\\t BuxSingh  to  have the agreement performed by Ganga  Bux  Singhcontemplated  the existence and the continued  existence  ofthe  agreement\\tso as to enable Shankar Bux  Singh  to\\tholdGanga Bux Singh to its performance, The continued  existenceof  the contract was in contemplation of the parties and  sofar  as\\t Ganga\\tBux Singh is concerned it was  at  no  stagecontemplated  that  he could forego the performance  of\\t theobligation  on his part to pay Rs. 50 per month\\t to  ShankarBux  Singh  during his lifetime so long as  the\\t will  stoodunrevoked.\\nIt  is\\tsignificant to observe on the other  hand  that\\t twoevents were contemplated so far as Shankar Bux Singh himselfwas  concerned.\\t The one was the withholding of the  consentof  the Court of  Wards and the other was the revocation  ofthe  will by Shankar Bux Singh himself.\\t The sum of  Rs.  50per  month was agreed to be paid by Ganga Bux Singh  to\\t himfrom the month when Shankar Bux Singh executed the will\\t andlaid  it  before the Court of Wards for its  sanction.\\t TheCourt of Wards might withhold its consent to the will and inthat  event whatever payments were made during the  intervalby  Ganga Bux Singh to Shankar Bux Singh had to be  refundedby  the\\t latter.   Even\\t though the  Court  of\\tWards  mightsanction  the will Shankar Bux Singh might later  on  revokethe  will  and the consequence of such revocation  was\\talsoprovided  in that Shankar Bux Singh was to refund  to  GangaBux  Singh the amounts which he had paid up to the  time  ofrevocation to Shankar Bux Singh in accordance with the termsof  the agreement.  It has to be observed moreover that\\t allthese  constituted  independent obligations on the  part  ofboth  the parties.  The obligation on the part of Ganga\\t BuxSingh  was  so long as the will stood unrevoked\\t to  pay  toShankar\\t Bux Singh Rs. 50 per month during his lifetime\\t andthe  obligation\\t on  the part of Shankar Bux  Singh  was  toobtain\\tthe consent of the Court of Wards and to  leave\\t thewill unrevoked during his lifetime.  These obligations\\twereindependent  of each other and the consequences of the\\tnon-performance of these obligations on the part of each of\\t theparties were expressly provided in the agreement itself.  Itcould not therefore be contended that the payment of Rs.  50per   month  to\\t Shankar  Bux  Singh  during  his   lifetimeconstituted  a\\tcondition precedent to the  vesting  of\\t thelegacy\\tin  his\\t favour.  That was  merely  a  considerationprovided by Ganga Bux Singh for the execution of the will byShankar\\t Bux  Singh  in his favour and if  Ganga  Bux  Singhcommitted a breach of the agreement the only result was thatShankar\\t Bux  Singh  would become entitled  to\\trecover\\t theamount due on such default929from  Ganga Bux Singh by having recourse to a court of\\tlaw.The  contract would continue to subsist, the  parties  beingrelegated  to  their  rights  and  remedies  thereunder\\t  ascontemplated by the parties.\\nIn spite of the non-payment by Ganga Bux Singh of the sum ofRs. 50 per month to Shankar Bux Singh in accordance with theterms  of  the agreement at no time did\\t Shankar  Bux  Singhrevoke the will nor did he pursue Ganga Bux Singh in a courtof  law for the recovery of the amounts in respect of  whichGanga Bux Singh was in default.\\t He left the will  unrevokedand on his death the will became effective as his last\\twilland  testament and operated to vest in Ganga Bux  Singh\\t ailinterest  in  the remainder as therein provided.   There  isnothing in the will itself which in terms makes the  bequestconditional  on\\t regular  payment of the  amount  under\\t theagreement.\\nThe  argument  which was advanced by Dr. Tekchand  based  onsection 81 of the Indian Trusts Act could not avail him\\t forthe  simple reason that the intention of Shankar  Bux  Singhhad  to be gathered as on the date of the execution  of\\t thewill  and  not\\tat any\\tsubsequent  time  thereafter.\\tThatintention  was clearly to effect a testamentary\\t dispositionof  the\\t remainder  in favour of Ganga Bux  Singh.   It\\t wascertainly farthest from the thought of Shankar Bux Singh notto  dispose of the beneficial interest in the  remainder  infavour\\tof Ganga Bux Singh with the result that there  couldneither\\t be  a\\tsecret\\ttrust  nor  a  trust  of   imperfectobligation  created  in favour of the heirs at\\tlaw  of\\t thetestator  Shankar Bux Singh.  The argument of  Dr.  Tekchandthat the remainder did not vest in Ganga Bux Singh but\\tfellinto  residue by reason of his having predeceased the  widowof Shankar Bux Singh is equally of no avail.  The legacy  infavour\\tof Ganga Bux Singh was a legacy of the remainder  ofthe estate which vested in Ganga Bux Singh but was  deferredin possession till after the extinction of the life interestcreated\\t in favour of the plaintiff 1. Such vested  interestcould  devolve\\tupon  the defendants, the  heirs  and  legalrepresentatives of120930Ganga  Bux  Singh  on  the  death  of  the  latter  and\\t the\\n-defendants  were  therefore as the heirs  and\\tlegal  representatives  of\\tGanga  Bux  Singh  since  deceased   rightlyentitled  to the same.\\tAs the bequest was  not\\t conditionaland  did  not  lapse  there could  be  no  question  of\\t anyresulting  trust  or of any intestacy with  respect  to\\t theremainder.\\nThe  result therefore is that the appeal fails and  must  bedismissed with costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\nAgent for the appellants : Rajinder Narain.Agent for the respondents: C.

In such a case section  42of the Income-tax Act would have no application.\"It  will  be  noticed that the\\tAgents\\tsucceeded  in  theircontentions  so\\t far as they related to\\t the  assessment  ofexcess\\tprofits tax.  The answers given by the\\tHigh  Court,however, went against them in so far as they related to\\t theassessment of income-tax for both the assessment years.The  Agents  thereafter made two applications  to  the\\tHighCourt under section 66A for leave to appeal to this Court inrespect\\t of the income-tax assessments for each of  the\\t twoassessment  years.  The High Court certified that the  caseswere  fit  for\\tappeal to this Court and  granted  leave  toappeal\\tand directed that the two appeals  be  consolidated.The  Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal,  however,\\t hasnot  preferred any appeal from that part of the judgment  ofthe High Court which sets forth its opinion on the questionsin so far as they relate to the assessment of excess profitstax.   This  appeal is, therefore, concerned only  with\\t theanswers\\t given by the High Court to the questions in so\\t faras they relate to the assessments of income-tax only.The first main contention urged by Mr. S. Mitra appearing insupport of this appeal is that no income, profits and  gainswere  received in India by or on behalf of the\\tAssociation.He  seeks  to  make good this contention  on  a\\t variety  ofreasons\\t all  of which are not quite  consistent  with\\teachother and some of526which  way  even be mutually destructive.   Relying  on\\t thedecisions  in  Narasammal  v. The  Secretary  of  State\\t forIndia(1)   and\\t Pondicherry   Railway\\t Company   Ltd.\\t  v.Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras(2). Mr. Mitra urges\\tthatno  income,  profits and gains were \"received\" in  India  atall,  for  the\\tAgents were nothing but\\t \"an  animated\\tPostOffice\".   We are bound to reject this reasoning as  unsoundon  the same grounds on which the Privy Council\\t rejected  asimilar\\t contention  in\\t the  case  of\\tPondicherry  RailwayCompany\\t Ltd.(2).  In  the language of\\tford  Macmillan\\t thefunctions of the Agents far transcended the mere  mechanicalact  of\\t transmitting  the sums collected  by  them  to\\t theAssociation  in Egypt.\\tThey were entrusted  with  importantduties on behalf of the Association, namely, selling of\\t thegoods  consigned  to them for sale,  handling  the  cargoes,issuing\\t delivery orders, collecting the sale  proceeds\\t andthen to remit the same after deducting the expenses incurredby  them and their own commission.  The description  of\\t \"ananimated Post Office\" can hardly. apply to an agent of\\tthisdescription.', 'Mr': 'Mitra thereupon shifts his ground and urges that even ifincome,\\t profits  and  gains were  received  in\\t India,\\t thereceipt\\t was  not by or on behalf of the  Association.\\t Thecontention  is\\tthat  though the  Agents  are  described  asagents,\\t they were not so in fact or in law and reliance  isplaced\\ton  the\\t well known case of Ex\\tparte  White(3).   Aperusal of that case will clearly show that there the personto  whom goods were consigned, together with a\\tprice  list,was, by their course of dealings, entitled to sell the goodsat any price he liked and that he remitted to the  consignorof the goods only the listed price, In other words, althoughthe  parties looked upon their dealings as  constituting  anagency.\\t the  consignee did not in fact sell  the  goods  asagent of the consignor but did so on his own account and anyprice realised in excess of the listed price was his own(1)  [1916] I.L.R. 39 Mad. 885.', '2': '2 Tax Cas. 321 at p. 327.\\n&  Co. v.

The case  Morleyv.  Tattersall(4)  also relied on by Mr.  Mitra\\t is  clearlydistinguishable because the liability for the sale  proceedsreceived  by the auctioneers continued to exist\\t even  afterthe  unclaimed balances were transferred to the\\t account  ofthe  partners and, therefore, they could not be regarded  astrade  receipts.  On the other hand, the case of Grainger  &Son  v.\\t William Lane Gough(5) will clearly  show  that\\t themoneys received by an agent on behalf his foreign  principalcould  be  regarded as including trade\\tprofits\\t within\\t themeaning of section 41 of the English Income Tax Act of\\t1842(See  per  Lord Herschell at p. 337 and Lord  Morris  at  p.\\n several passages quoted in the  judgment  underappeal\\tfrom  the  cases of Neilson Anderson  &\\t Company  v.Collins\\t and  Taru v.

There can, therefore, - be no questionthat  when  the\\t gross sale proceeds were  received  by\\t theAgents\\tin India they necessarily received whatever  income,profits and gains were lying dormant or hidden, or otherwiseembedded in theni.

In our -opinion there is no substancein the first main contention a umbrated by Mr. S. Mitra.Mr.  Mitra\\'s second main point is that, assuming that  therewas receipt of income, profits and gains within India,\\tsuchincome,\\t profits and gains clearly arose through or  from  abusiness connection in India and, therefore, the  provisionsof  section 42( 1) would apply and such income, profits\\t andgains should be dealt with income, profits and gains  deemedto  accrue or arise in India and consequently the  inclusionof such income, profits and gains in the total income shouldbe  under  section  4 (1) (c) for the  Association  is\\tnon-resident.  Mr. Mitra urges that the charging under section 3is to be \" in accordance with and subject to the  provisionsof this Act\".  Likewise, section 4 (1) is also \" subject  tothe  provisions of this Act.\" This, according to Mr.  Mitra,at  once  attracts section 42 and such income,\\tprofits\\t andgains being within section 42 must be included in section  4(1) (c) and the other alternative, i.e., section 4 (1)\\t(a),is  no longer applicable.  In other words, according to\\t Mr.Mitra\\'s contention, section 4 (1) (a) becomes a dead  letterso  far as income, profits and gains arising or accruing  toa.  non-resident are concerned.\\t We are unable to accede  tothis  contention.  Section 42 only speaks of deemed  income.The whole object of that section is to make certain  income,profits\\t and gains to-be deemed to arise in India so  as  tobring  them to charge.\\tThe receipt of the income,  profits,and  gains being one of the tests of liability531where the income, profits and gains are actually received inIndia it is no longer necessary for the revenue\\t authoritiesto have recourse to the fiction and this has been held quiteclearly in Hira Mills Ltd. v.Income-tax Officer, Cawnpore(1)and  in\\t Burugu,  Nagayya and  Rajanna\\tv.  Commissioner  ofIncome-tax,  Madras  (2).   This is  also  implicit  in\\t thedecision of the Privy Council in Pondicherry Railway CompanyLtd.,  v.  Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras(5),  to  whichreference has already been made.  Section 4(1) (a) in  termsis,  unlike section 4 (1) (b) or 4 (1) (c), not confined  inits  application  to any particular category  of  assessees.\\'Section 4 (1) (a is general and applies to a resident or  anon-resident  person.  The second proviso to section 4\\t(1),although  it relates to the case of a person not  ordinarilyresident,  also\\t indicates that income,\\t profits  and  gainswhich  accrue or arise to such a person without the  taxableterritories can be included in his total income if they\\t arebrought\\t into  or received in the  taxable  territories\\t andbecome chargeable to fax under section 3 read with section 4(1) (a).  For reasons hereinbefore stated this contention of\\n must  be\\t rejected.   It\\t may  be  that\\t theconstruction  we  are, adopting in agreement with  the\\tHighCourt  may  operate  harshly against  nonresidents  in\\tthatincome,\\t  profits   and\\t gains\\tattributable   to   businessoperations  outside India may also be brought to  charge  ashaving been received in India and such consequence may deternon-resident merchants from doing business in India.   Theseindeed\\tare  serious considerations but the Courts  have  toconstrue  the statute according to the plain\\'  language\\t andtenor  thereof\\tand  if\\t any  untoward\\tconsequences  resulttherefrom  it  is  for authority other than  this  Court  torectify or prevent the same.\\nThe  last main point urged by Mr. Mitra is that as  soon  asTurner\\tMorrison & Co. Ltd., were treated as  agent\\'s  undersection\\t 43, the provisions of section 42  were\\t immediatelyattracted.   In support of this contention Mr. Mitra  relieson the decisions in Imperial(1)  [1946] 14 I.T.R. 417 at P. 423.

A report of the theft was made tothe police authorities and an investigation was made by\\t thepolice,\\t as  well as the appellants in the  matter  with  noresult.\\t  The management of the appellants  thereafter\\ttookaction\\tagainst one J.

An industrial dispute inrespect of the non-employment of the said J. P.

The respondents 2, 3\\tand  4\\twereaccordingly  dismissed from their employ by  the  appellantswith effect from the 13th October, 1950.\\nAn   industrial  dispute  thereupon  arose   between\\ttheappellants  and\\t respondents 2, 3 and 4 in  respect  of\\t the\\n-non-employment of respondents 2,3 and 4 and respondent 1, aregistered trade union, of Which the respondents 2, 3 and  4were  members,\\tultimately moved the  Regional\\tConciliationBoard  (Textiles and Hosiery), Kanpur, on the 1st  November,1950,  challenging  the\\t propriety and\\tbona  fides  of\\t theappellants  in terminating the services of respondents 2,  3and 4.\\nThe  appellants filed their written statement on the  25thNovember, 1950, contending inter alia that the dismissal wasfully  justified, regular and proper, having\\' been  made  inaccordance  with the permission accorded by  the  AdditionalRegional  Conciliation\\tOfficer.  The only issue  which\\t wascanvassed before the Regional Conciliation Board was whetherany  or\\t all of the three workmen named in  the\\t applicationdated  the  1st\\t November, 1950,  has/have  been  wrongfullydismissed  and\\tif so, to what relief is  he/they  entitled.The Board consisted of three members, Shri R. P. Maheshwari,Chairman,  and\\tShri  B. B. Singh and  Shri  J.\\t K.  Bhagat,Members.  Shri J. K. Bhagat was not present on the last dateof  the\\t hearing and the award was therefore signed  on\\t the20th  April, 1951, by Shri R. P. Maheshwari and Shri  B.  B.Singh.\\tUnder the terms of the award the Board held that thedismissal  was wrongful and that the respondents 2, 3 and  4were  entitled to reinstatement as also to the\\tfull  wages,including   dearness  allowance\\t from  the  date  of   theirsuspension to the date they were taken back on duty.  The\\tappellants  preferred  an  appeal  to  the   LabourAppellate Tribunal of India, Calcutta.\\tThe appeal was heardon the 16th August, 1951, and the Labour Appellate  Tribunaldismissed  the\\tappeal of the  appellants.   The  appellantsobtained special leave from this Court and filed the presentappeal.\\nTwo  contentions  were urged by Shri C.  K.  Daphtary\\twhoappeared for the appellants before us-(1) that the award wasvoid  and inoperative as it was made by only two members  ofthe Board, the third, member, Shri J. K. Bhagat not  having-been  present at the last hearing and-not having signed\\t thesame  and  (2)\\tthat the  Additional  Regional\\tConciliationOfficer having given the written permission for dismissal ofrespondents 2, 3 and 4 no industrial dispute could arise  byreason of the -non-employment of respondents 2, 3 and 4\\t andthe   Regional\\t Conciliation\\tBoard\\thad   therefore\\t  nojurisdiction to entertain the application made before it  byrespondent 1 on behalf of the respondents 2, 3 and 4 and theaward  of  the\\tRegional  Conciliation\\tBoard  ordering\\t thereinstatement  of  respondents\\t2, 3  and  4  was  thereforewithout\\t jurisdiction, void and inoperative and\\t the  LabourAppellate Tribunal was in error in confirming the same.  In  support of his first contention Shri C.  K.  Daphtaryrelied upon clause 4 and clause 7, sub-clause (3) of the  G.N. No. 781 (L)/XVIII, dated 10th March, 1948, issued by\\t theUnited\\tProvinces Government regarding the  constitution  ofRegional  Conciliation Boards and Industrial Courts for\\t thesettlement of industrial disputes within the State. Clause 4-\" No business may be transacted at any meeting ofany Board unless all the three members are present Clause 7 (3)-\" Where no amicable settlement can be reachedon one or more issues the Board, if all the members  thereofagree  or  if  they do not so  agree,  the  majority  of,themembers\\t -agreeing or if no two members agree, the  Chairmanalone, shall record an award and the reasons for such award,on the issues -on which the parties were unable to reach  anamicable settlement.\"\\n K.\\tDaphtary therefore urged that  Shri  J.\\t K.Bhagat\\tnot having been present at the last meeting  of\\t theBoard and not having signed the784award  the award could not be lawfully made by the  Chairmanand  the  other member who were present and who\\t signed\\t theaward  and  the award was therefore  void  and\\tinoperative.Shri  C. P. Varma who represented the respondent  before  ushowever\\t drew  tour attention to the  Government  Order\\t No.388(11)/  XVIII/37  (LL)-/50 dated 2nd\\tMarch,\\t1951,  whichamended the above clauses 4 and 7(3).\\nClause 4 as amended provides:-\\n\" (1) Notice of every meeting of the Board shall begiven to the members by the Chairman in advance.  ( 2)\\t If apart from the Chairman either or both theother\\t  members fail to attend any meeting of the Board ofwhich  notice  has  been given to  them,  the  Chairman\\t maytransact the business\\' of the Board without the presence  ofthe  absent  member  or members ; and no  such\\tbusiness  orproceedings,  of the Board shall be held invalid  merely  byreason\\tof the fact that either one or both of\\tthe  memberswere not present at the meeting.\"\\nClause 7 (3) as amended provides:-\\n\"Where  no amicable settlement can be reached on  one\\t ormore  issues, if all the members present agree the Board  orif they do not so agree the majority of the members agreeing\\'or if no two members present agree or if only the  Chairmanis present, he alone, shall record an award and the  reasonsfor  such  award  on the issues on which  the  parties\\twereunable to reach an amicable settlement.\"\\nThese amendments in the clauses 4 and 7 (3) are enough\\t inour  opinion to repel the contention of Shri C. K.  Daphtarythat the absence of Shri J. K. Bhagat from the last  meetingand also his non-participation in the making and signing  ofthe  award  rendered.the award void  and  inoperative.\\t TheBoard was empowered under the amended clauses 4 and 7(3)  toact in the absence of Shri J. K. Bhagat and the award as  itwas made and signed by the two remaining members, viz., ShriR. P. Maheshwari and Shri B.  B.   Singh,  was\\tlawful\\t andbinding on the parties.\\nIn  support  of his second contention Shri  C.\\tK.  Daphtaryrelied upon clauses 23 and 24 of the Government Notificationdated the 10th March, 1948, above referred to.  Clause  23  :-\" Save with the written Permission  of\\ttheRegional  Conciliation\\tOfficer or  the\\t Assistant  RegionalConciliation  Officer  concerned irrespective  of  the\\tfactwhether an enquiry is pending before a Regional ConciliationBoard-or the Provincial Conciliation Board or an appeal\\t hasbeen  filed  before the Industrial Court, no  employer,\\t hisagent  or  manager, shall discharge or dismiss\\tany  workmenduring\\tthe continuance of an enquiry or appeal and  pendingthe  issue  of the orders of the State Government  upon\\t thefindings of the said Court...........\\nClause\\t 24:-\"(1)  Except as  hereinbefore  provided  everyorder made or direction issued under the provisions of\\tthisOrder  shall  be  final\\t and conclusive\\t and  shall  not  bequestioned by any party thereto in any proceeding........... Shri  C. K. Daphtary contended that the order made by\\ttheAdditional   Regional  Conciliation  Officer  on  the\\t12thOctober\\'  1950, giving the appellants permission to  dismissrespondents 2, 3 and 4 was final and conclusive in regard tothe appellants\\' right to dismiss them from their employ\\t andtheir  dismissal accordingly by the appellants could not  bethe  foundation\\t of any industrial dispute  which  could  bereferred to the Regional Conciliation Board at the  instanceof respondent 1. He further contended that if no  industrialdispute\\t could thus arise the Regional\\tConciliation,  Boardhad no jurisdiction to entertain the same and the award madeby  the Board was therefore without jurisdiction, -void\\t andinoperative  and could not also be confirmed by\\t the  LabourAppellate Tribunal.\\nWe  are unable to accept this contention.  The\\t GovernmentNotification  dated  10th  March, 1948, was  issued  by\\t theGovernor  of the United Provinces in exercise of the  powersconferred by clauses (b), (c),786', 'd': \"and  (g)  of  section 3 and section 8  of\\tthe  ,UnitedProvinces  Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  It  provided\\t forthe constitution by the Provincial Government of such numberof Conciliation Boards as might be deemed necessary for\\t thesettlement  of\\tindustrial  disputes  consisting  of   threemembers of which one was to be the Conciliation Officer\\t forthe area, one was to be representative of the employers\\t andone   was   to\\tbe  the\\t representative\\t of   workmen,\\t theConciliation Officer for the area being the Chairman of\\t theBoard.\\tThe order provided for the mode in which  industrialdisputes  may be referred to the Board for enquiry  and\\t themanner\\tin which the enquiry was to be conducted.   It\\talsoprovided  for the constitution by the Provincial  Governmentof such number of Industrial Courts as it might be necessaryconsisting  of a President assisted by such equal number  ofassessors  as  the President  might  determine\\trepresentingemployers and employees.  Provision was made for appeals  tosuch Industrial Courts from the awards of the Board and alsofor  the hearing of the said appeals.  After making  furtherprovision for the procedure to be adopted before the  Boardsas  well  as the Industrial Courts, the Order by  clause  23above mentioned imposed a' ban on the discharge or dismissalof any workman by the employer, his agent or manager  duringthe pendency of an enquiry before the Regional\\tConciliationBoard  or the Provincial Conciliation Board or of an  appealbefore\\t the  Industrial  Court\\t except\\t with  the   writtenpermission  of\\tthe  Regional Conciliation  Officer  or\\t theAssistant  Regional  Conciliation Officer concerned  and  byclause\\t24  made every order or direction issued  under\\t theprovisions of the said Government Order final and conclusiveexcept as thereinbefore provided.\\nIt is clear that clause 23 imposed a ban on the dischargeor  dismissal  of  any workman pending\\tthe  enquiry  of  anindustrial dispute before the Board or an appeal before\\t theIndustrial  Court  and the employer, his  agent\\t or  managercould only discharge or dismiss787the  workman  with the written permission  of  the  RegionalConciliation Officer or the Assistant Regional\\tConciliationOfficer\\t concerned.   Even if such) written  permission\\t wasforthcoming  the employer, his I agent or manager  might  ormight  not  discharge or, dismiss the workman and  the\\tonlyeffect of such written permission would be to remove the banagainst the discharge or dismissal of the workman during thependency  of those proceedings.\\t The  Regional\\tConciliationOfficer\\t or  the  Assistant  Regional  Conciliation  Officerconcerned  would  institute  an\\t enquiry  and  come  to\\t theconclusion whether there was a prima facie case made out forthe discharge or dismissal of the workman and the  employer,his  agent  or\\tmanager was not\\t actuated  by  any  impropermotives\\t or  did  not  resort  to  any\\tunfair\\tpractice  orvictimisation  in  the matter of the proposed  discharge  ordismissal of the workman.  But he was not entrusted, as\\t theBoard  or  the Industrial Court would be, with the  duty  ofcoming to the conclusion whether the discharge or  dismissalof  the workman during the pendency of the  proceedings\\t waswithin\\tthe  rights of the employer, his agent\\tor  manager.The  enquiry  to be conducted by the  Regional\\tConciliationOfficer\\t or  the  Assistant  Regional  Conciliation  Officerconcerned  was not an enquiry into an industrial dispute  asto  the non-employment of the workman who was sought  to  bedischarged or dismissed, which industrial dispute would onlyarise after an employer, his agent or manager discharged  ordismissed  the\\tworkman\\t in  accordance\\t with  the   writtenpermission  obtained from the officer concerned.   This\\t wasthe   only  scope  of  the  enquiry  before   the   RegionalConciliation Officer or the Assistant Regional\\tConciliationOfficer\\t concerned and the effect of the written  permissionwas not to validate the discharge or dismissal but merely toremove the ban on the powers of the 'employer, his agent  ormanager\\t to  discharge\\tor dismiss the\\tworkman\\t during\\t thependency  of the proceedings.  Once such written  permissionwas granted by him that102788,order made or direction issued by him was to be final\\tlandconclusive and was not to be questioned by any party theretoin any proceedings.  The only effect of )clause 24(1) was toprevent\\t  any\\tparty  to  the\\tpending\\t  proceedings\\tfromchallenging  the  written  permission thus  granted  by\\t theofficer concerned Such written permission could not be\\tmadethe  subject-matter of any appeal at the instance of  eitherparty and both the parties would be bound by the order\\tmadeor  direction issued by the officer concerned so far  as  itgave or refused the permission to the employer, his agent ormanager in the matter of the proposed discharge or dismissalof the workman.\\nThis was the only scope of the provisions of clauses 23\\t and24 (1) above. mentioned.  '-Once the written permission\\t wasgranted\\t by  the  officer concerned,  the  ban\\tagainst\\t thedischarge  or dismissal of the workman would be removed\\t andthe employer, his agent or manager could in the exercise  ofhis discretion discharge or dismiss the workman but in\\tthatevent  an  industrial  dispute within  the  meaning  of\\t itsdefinition  contained  in  section 2(k)\\t of  the  IndustrialDisputes Act, 1947, would arise and the workmen who had beendischarged  or\\tdismissed  would be entitled  to  have\\tthatindustrial  dispute  referred to the  Regional\\tConciliationBoard for enquiry into the Same.  That right of the  workmanto  raise an industrial dispute could not be taken  away  inthe manner suggested by Shri C. K. Daphtary by having resortto  the provisions of clauses 23 and 24(1) aforesaid.\\tThatright  was  given  to  the  workman  by\\t the  terms  of\\t theIndustrial  Disputes  Act,  1947, and  the  U.P.  IndustrialDisputes Act, XXVIII of 1947, and would remain unaffected byany of the provisions hereinbefore referred to.We  are\\t therefore, of the opinion that this  contention  ofShri C. K. Daphtary also fails.\\nWe may before concluding advert to one circumstance and thatis  that even though the Labour Appellate  Tribunal  rightlyconfined its jurisdiction to789determining  substantial  questions of law involved  in\\t theappeal, it nevertheless observed that even on the) facts theconclusions of the Board were perfectly justified and  therewas  no\\t substance  in the appeal on merits  as\\t well.\\t Theappellants  were  not  heard at all on merits;\\tand  it\\t washardly\\tlegitimate  for the Labour, Appellate  Tribunal\\t suomotu  to consider the merits of the appeal and arrive  at  afinding\\t in  regard  to\\t the same.' If\\tat  all\\t the  LabourAppellate  Tribunal  bad any jurisdiction in regard  to\\t themerits it was incumbent upon it to have heard the appellantsin  regard to the merits before arriving at a conclusion  inregard to the same.\\nThe  result is that this appeal fails and must be  dismissedwith costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\nAgent for the appellant : S.

Afterseveral proceedings which it is not necessary to mention forthe  purpose  of  this\\tappeal,\\t the  District\\t Magistrate,Bankura, in M. P. No. 58 of 1950 under sections 431 and\\t 432of the Bengal Municipal Act on the 14th August, 1951,  foundthat the stock of mustard seeds which was seized on the\\t 6thMarch, 1950, was on that date and still was unfit for  humanconsumption.  But in so far as no oil was coming out of\\t theseeds and the seeds were capable of being used is manure  orfor  cattle-food he would not direct their  destruction\\t butdirected   that\\t  they\\tshould\\tbe  disposed   of   by\\t theCommissioners  of the Bankura Municipality as manure  or  ascattle-food ensuring before such disposal that the stocks inquestion bad been rendered incapable of being used as  humanfood.  The respondents filed a petition under section 435 ofthe  Criminal Procedure Code before the Additional  SessionsJudge,\\t Bankura,   against  the  order\\t of   the   DistrictMagistrate,  for  a  reference\\tto  the\\t High  Court.\\t TheAdditional  Sessions  Judge  held that the  seizure  of\\t themustard seeds was illegal and that there was no evidence  toshow that the seeds in question were deposited in or broughtto  the\\t places\\t for  the  purpose  of\\ttheir  sale  or\\t  ofpreparation of oil for human consumption.  He therefore madea reference under section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Codeto the High Court for quashing the proceedings.\\t Chunder  J.accepted the reference, set aside the order of the  DistrictMagistrate  and remanded the case for retrial by some  otherMagistrate,  as\\t in the opinion of the\\tlearned\\t Judge,\\t theDistrict  Magistrate  had decided the matter  upon  his\\t ownobservations  formed  during the inspection of\\tthe  mustardseeds and not on the material in the record.  An applicationwas made to a Bench of the High Court and leave was  allowedon  the\\t point whether Chunder J. had  jurisdiction  sittingsingly\\tto  bear  the reference in view of  the\\t rule  citedabove.\\nSri  N.C.Taluqdar  for the appellants-urged that  the  ordermade by the District Magistrate, Bankura, under sections 431and 432 of the Bengal Municipal Act, 1932, was an order\\t forforfeiture of property within the meaning of the proviso  tothe rule and Chunder J. had no jurisdiction to deal with thereference and his order should be quashed.Section 431 provides:-', '\"1': 'Where any living thing, article of food, drug  seizedunder  section\\t428 is not destroyed by consent\\t under\\tsub-section\\t (1) of section 429, or where an article of food  soseized\\twhich  is perishable is not dealt  with\\t under\\tsub-section(2)  of\\tthat  section, it shall be  taken  before  aMagistrate as soon as may be after such seizure. (2)If\\tit appears to the Magistrate that any  such  livingthing  is diseased or unsound or that any such food or\\tdrugis  unsound,  unwholesome  or unfit for human  food  or\\t formedicine,  as the case may be............... he shall  causethe  same  to be destroyed at the expense of the  person  inwhose possession it was at the time of its seizure, or to beotherwise  disposed of by the Commissioners so as not to  becapable of being used as human food or medicine Section 432 provides : -\\n\"When\\tany\\'  authority directs in exercise of\\tany  powersconferred  by  this chapter, the destruction of\\t any  livingthing,\\tfood or any drug, or the disposal of the same so  asto  prevent  its being used as food or\\tmedicine,  the\\tsameshall  thereupon  be  deemed  to  be  the  property  of\\t theCommissioners.\"\\nThe  word  \"forfeiture\"  is  defined  in  Murray\\'s  OxfordDictionary:-\"  The  fact  of losing or\\tbecoming  liable  todeprivation of goods in consequence of a crime, offence,  orbreach of engagement the penalty of the transgression\" or  a\"punishment  for an offence\".  It was contended that  in  sofar as section 432 provided for the vesting of the condemnedfood or drug in the Commissioners the owner of the  propertywas divested or deprived of the proprietary771rights\\ttherein\\t and that the order made by  the  Magistrateunder section 431 (2) was thus an order of forfeiture of theproperty.\\nThis  contention in our opinion is unsound.  According\\t tothe dictionary meaning of the word \"forfeiture\" the loss  orthe  deprivation of goods has got to be in consequence of  acrime,\\toffence or breach of engagement or has to be by\\t wayof  penalty of the transgression or a punishment for an\\t offonce.  Unless the loss or deprivation of the goods is by wayof a penalty or punishment for a crime, offence or breach ofengagement it would not come within the definition of  for.-feiture.   What\\t is  provided under section  431(2)  is\\t thedestruction   of  the  food  or\\t drug  which   is   unsound,unwholesome  or\\t unfit\\tfor human food or  medicine  or\\t theotherwise  disposal of the same by the Commissioners  so  asnot  to be capable of being used as human food or  medicine.The   vesting  of  such\\t condemned  food  or  drug  in\\t theCommissioners  which  is provided by section 432 is  with  aview to facilitate the destruction or the otherwise disposalof such food or drug by the Commissioners and is in no way aforfeiture  of such food or drug by the\\t Municipality.\\t Thecondemned food or drug by reason of its being found unsound,unwholesome  or unfit for human food or medicine  cannot  bedealt with by the owner.  It must be destroyed or  otherwisedisposed of so as to prevent its being used as human food ormedicine.  What the Municipal Commissioners are empowered todo therefore is what the owner himself would be expected  todo and what is ordered to be done therefore cannot amount toa forfeiture of the property.  The order is not a punishmentfor  a crime but is a measure to ensure that  the  condemnedfood or drug is not used as human food or medicine. That  this  is the true position is clear  from  the  pro-visions\\t of  Chapter  XXIV of the  Act\\twhich  provides\\t forpenalties.   Sections  501 to 504  prescribe  penalties\\t forspecific  offences  and\\t section  500  prescribes  generallypenalties  for\\tthe  several  offences\\ttherein\\t  mentioned.Section 431 however does not figure therein.\\nForfeiture  of property is thus not one of the penalties  orpunishments for any of the offences mentioned in the  BengalMunicipal  Act.\\t  In the relevant provision in the  rule  ofthe\\'   High   Court   an  order\\t of   sentence\\t of   death,transportation,\\t penal servitude, forfeiture of property  orof  imprisonment  are grouped together.\\t  These\\t orders\\t arepurely\\torders\\tby  way of penalty  or\\tpunishment  for\\t thecommission  of\\tcrimes\\tor offences and\\t the  forfeiture  ofproperty  mentioned there is no other than the one which  isentailed  as a consequence of the commission of a  crime  oroffence.   In order that such forfeiture of  property  wouldbar  the  jurisdiction of the single Judge it has  to  be  aforfeiture  of property which is provided by way of  penaltyor punishment for the commission of a crime or offence.\\t  Inspite  of his labours Shri N. C. Taluqdar has not been\\tableto  point  out to us any provision of the  Bengal  MunicipalAct,  1932,  which constitutes what  is\\t contemplated  undersection\\t 431(2), a penalty or punishment for the  commissionof  a  crime or offence.  The offence  that  the  respondentcould  be charged with is defined in section 421 of the\\t Actand the punishment for that offence provided in section\\t 500is fine and not forfeiture.\\nWe  are  therefore of the opinion that the  order  of\\ttheDistrict Magistrate, Bankura, under sections 431 and 432  ofthe Bengal Municipal Act, 1932, dated 14th August, 1951, wasnot an order of forfeiture of property within the meaning ofthe  proviso to rule 9, Chapter II, Part I, of the Rules  ofthe  High  Court,  and Chunder J. had  the  jurisdiction  toentertain and decide the reference.  The result is that\\t theappeal fails and is dismissed.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\nAgent for the appellant : Sukumar Ghose.\\nAgent for respondent: B. B.

On 28th August, 1949, there was an order in terms  ofsection\\t 3 of the Special Tribunal Regulation No. V of\\t1358F., which was in force at that time, directing the appellantto be tried by the Special Tribunal (A).  The accused  beinga public officer, the sanction of the Military Governor\\t wasnecessary  to prosecute him and this sanction was  given  on20th  September,  1949.\\t  On  13th  December,  1949,  a\\t newRegulation, being Regulation No. X of 1359F., was passed  bythe  Hyderabad Government which ended the Special  Tribunalscreated\\t under\\tthe  previous Regulation on  and  from\\t16thDecember, 1949 ; and consequently upon such termination pro-vided  for the appointment, power and procedure\\t of  SpecialJudges.\\t  Section 4 of the Regulation authorised  the  ChiefMinister  to  appoint, after consulting the High  Court,  asmany Special Judges as may from time to time be required forthe purpose of section 5.

On 29th September, 1950, the  learned  Judgesdelivered  differing  judgments, Shripat Rao J.\\t taking\\t theview  that the appeal should be dismissed, while  the  otherlearned Judge expressed the opinion that the appeal ought tobe  allowed  and the accused acquitted.\\t The case  was\\tthenreferred to Mr. Justice Manohar Prasad, as a third Judge andby  his\\t judgment  dated the 11th  of  December,  1960,\\t thelearned Judge agreed with the opinion of Shripat Rao J.\\t anddismissed the appeal upholding the conviction and  sentencespassed\\tby the Special Judge.  The appellant then  presentedan  application\\t for leave to appeal to\\t this  court.\\tThatapplication was rejected by the High Court of Hyderabad, butspecial\\t leave to appeal was granted by this court  on\\t11thMay,  1951, and it is on the strength of this special  leavethat the appeal has come before us.\\nThe  present hearing of the appeal is confined to  certainconstitutional\\t points\\t which\\thave  been  raised  by\\t theappellant  attacking the legality of the entire trial  whichresulted in his conviction on the ground that the  procedurefor  trial laid down in Regulation X of 1359F.\\tbecame\\tvoidafter  the 26th of January, 1960, by reason of its being  inconflict  with\\tthe  equal  protection\\tclause\\tembodied  inarticle 14 of the Constitution.\\t These grounds have been setforth  in a separate petition filed by the  appellant  underarticle\\t 32 of the Constitution and following the  procedureadopted in the case of Qasim Razvi [Case No. 276666of  1951(1)],we\\t decided  to  hear  arguments  on  the\\tcon-stitutional  questions as,preliminary points in\\t the  appealitself.\\t  Whether the appeal would have to be heard  furtheror  not would depend on the decision which we arrive  at  inthe present hearing.\\nThe  substantial contention put forward by  Mr.  Peerbhoy,who  appeared  in  support of the appeal,  is  that  as\\t theprocedure  for\\ttrial prescribed by Regulation X  of  1359F.deviated to a considerable extent from the normal  procedurelaid  down  by the general law and deprived the\\t accused  ofsubstantial  benefits to which otherwise he would have\\tbeenentitled, -the Regulation became void under article 13(1) ofthe  Constitution on and from the 26th of January, 1950\\t Theconviction  and the sentences resulting from  the  procedurethus   adopted\\t must,\\ttherefore,  be\\theld   illegal\\t andinoperative and the judgment of the Special Judge as well asof the High Court should be quashed.  The other point raisedby  the learned counsel is that the making over of the\\tcaseof  the\\t appellant to the Special Judge was illegal  as\\t theauthority to make over such cases was not properly delegatedby  the\\t Chief Minister to the Civil  Administrator  in\\t themanner contemplated by section 5 of the Regulation. As regards the first point, it is to be noted at the  out-set  that  the impugned Regulation  was\\t a  pre-Constitutionstatute.   In determining the validity or otherwise of\\tsuchlegislation  on\\t the ground of any of its  provisions  beingrepugnant  to  the equal protection clause,  two  principleswould have to be borne in mind, which were enunciated by themajority  of  this court in the case of Qasim Razvi  v.\\t TheState  of  Hyderabad (1), decided on the  19th\\tof  January,1953, where the earlier decision in Lachman Das Kewalram  v.The   State  of\\t Bombay(1)  was\\t discussed  and\\t  explained.Firstly,  the Constitution has no retrospective\\t effect\\t andeven  if the law is in any sense discriminatory, it must  beheld to be valid for all past transactions and for  enforce-ment of rights and liabilities accrued before the(1) [1953] S.C.R. 589.\\t (2) [1952] S.C.R. 710.\\ncoming\\tinto force of the Constitution.\\t  Secondly,  article13(1)  of  the Constitution does not  necessarily  make\\t thewhole\\tstatute\\t invalid  even\\tafter  the  advent  of\\t theConstitution.\\tIt invalidates only those  provisions  whichare  inconsistent  with the  fundamental  rights  guaranteedunder  Part  III of the Constitution.  The  statute  becomesvoid only to the extent of such inconsistency but  otherwiseremains\\t valid and operative.  As was said in Qasim  Razvi\\'scase(1) the fact that \" trial was continued even after\\t26thJanuary,  1950, under the same Regulation would\\t not  neces-sarily render the subsequent proceedings invalid.  All\\tthatthe  accused could claim is that what remained of the  trialmust  not  deviate  from the  normal  standard\\tin  materialrespects,  so  as  to  amount  to  a  denial  of  the  equalprotection  of laws within the meaning of article 14 of\\t theConstitution.\\tFor the purpose of determining\\twhether\\t theaccused\\t was  deprived of such protection, we  have  to\\t seefirst  of all whether after eliminating\\t the  discriminatoryprovisions  in\\tthe  Regulation, it was\\t still\\tpossible  tosecure to the accused substantially the benefits of a  trialunder the ordinary law; and if so, whether that was actuallydone in the particular case.\"\\nAs  has  been\\tstated\\talready,  the  Special\\tJudge  tookcognizance  of\\tthis  case on the  5th\\tof  January,  1950,\\'which was prior to the advent of the Constitution.  It\\tmustbe  held,  therefore, that the Special\\tJudge  was  lawfullyseized\\tof the case, and it is not possible to say that\\t theappointment of a Special Judge was in itself an\\t inequality.in the eye of the law.\\tThe trial undoubtedly commenced fromthe  11th of February, 1950, that is to say,  subsequent  tothe coming into force of the Constitution, and the  questionthat  requires consideration is, whether the procedure\\tthatwas actually followed by the Special Judge acting under\\t theimpugned Regulation did give the accused the substance of  anormal trial, or, in other words, whether he had been  givena fair measure of equality in the matter of procedure ?(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 589.', 'Mr': 'Peerbhoy lays stress on two sets of provisions in theimpugned  Regulation which, according to him,  differentiatethe procedure prescribed in it from that laid down under theordinary  law.\\tThe first set relates to the elimination  ofthe  committal\\tproceeding and the substitution\\t of  warrantprocedure  for\\tthe  sessions  procedure  in  the  trial  ofoffences.   The\\t other set-of provisions consists  of  thosewhich  deny  to\\t the  accused the  rights  of  revision\\t andtransfer  and withdraw from him the safeguards\\trelating  toconfirmation   of  sentences.\\tThe  first  branch  of\\t thecontention,  in our opinion, is unsustainable having  regardto  our decision in Qasim Razvi\\'s case(1).  It\\twas  pointedout in that case that under the Hyderabad Criminal ProcedureCode  the  committal  proceeding,is  not  an   indispensablepreliminary to a sessions trial.  Under section 267A of\\t theHyderabad  Criminal Procedure Code, the Magistrate is  quitecompetent,  either without recording any evidence  or  afterrecording  only\\t a  portion of the evidence,  to  commit  anaccused for trial by the sessions court if, in his  opinion,there  are  sufficient grounds for such committal.   If\\t thecommittal  proceeding  is left out of account as  not  beingcompulsory, and its absence did not operate to take away thejurisdiction of the Special Judge to take cognizance of\\t thecase  before  the  Constitution, the  difference  between  awarrant\\t procedure prescribed by the impugned Regulation  tobe  followed by the Special Judge after such cognizance\\t wastaken  and the sessions procedure at that  stage  applicableunder  the  general law is not at all substantial,  and\\t theminor  differences  would  not bring  the  case\\t within\\t themischief  of article 14 of the Constitution.  This  questionhaving\\tbeen already decided in Qasim Razvi\\'s case(1) it  isnot open for further arguments in the present one.  With\\t regard\\t to  the  other\\t set  of  provisions,\\tthecontention  of\\tMr.  Peerbhoy is  based\\t entirely  upon\\t thelanguage  of section 8 of the Regulation.  In  our  opinion,the  interpretation which the learned counsel seeks  to\\t putupon the section is not quite correct,(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 589.\\nand it seems to us that not only the right of an accused  toapply  for transfer of his case has not been taken  away  bythis  section, but the right of revision also has been\\tleftunaffected except to a small extent.\\nSection  8  of\\t the Regulation X of 1359 F.  is  in  theseterms:-\\n\"All  the provisions of section 7 of the  said\\t Regulationshall  have  effect  in relation to sentences  passed  by  aSpecial\\t Judge as if every reference in the said  Regulationto  a  Special Tribunal included a reference  to  a  SpecialJudge.\"\\nThe  expression  \"said Regulation\" means  and\\t refers\\t toRegulation V of 1358 F. and section 7 of the said Regulationprovides inter alia that \"there shall save as here in beforeprovided, be no appeal from any order or sentence passed  bya  Special  Tribunal, and no court shall have  authority  torevise\\tsuch order or sentence or to transfer any case\\tfromSpecial\\t Tribunal  or have any jurisdiction of any  kind  inrespect\\t of any proceeding before a Special Tribunal and  nosentence  of  a\\t Special Tribunal shall\\t be  subject  to  orsubmitted for confirmation by any authority whatsoever.\"  Itwill be noticed that what section 8 of the impugned  Regula-tion does, is to incorporate, not the whole of section 7  ofthe  previous  Regulation, but only such portion  of  it  asrelates\\t to  sentences\\tpassed\\tby  a  Special\\tJudge.\\t  By\"sentence\"  is\\tmeant  obviously  the  final  or  definitivepronouncement of the criminal court which culminates or endsin  a  sentence as opposed to an \"order\",  interlocutory  orotherwise, where no question of infliction\\' of any  sentenceis  involved.\\tThe  scope  of\\tsection\\t 7  of\\tthe  earlierRegulation is thus much wider than that of present section 8and all the limitations of the earlier statute have not beenrepeated in the present one.  The result, therefore, is thatrevision against any order which has hot ended in a sentenceis  not interdicted by the present Regulation, nor  has\\t theright of applying for transfer, which has no reference to  asentence, been touched at all.\\tThese rights are  expressly-preserved by section 10 of the present87670Regulation,  which  makes the Code  of\\tCriminal  \\'Procedureapplicable  in all matters except where the  Regulation\\t hasprovided  otherwise.   Reading\\tsection\\t 8  of\\tthe  presentRegulation with section 7 of the earlier one, it may be heldthat  what  has been taken away from an accused is,  in\\t thefirst  place, the right of revision  against  non-appealablesentences,  and\\t in  the  second-  place,  -the\\t  provisionsrelating  -to confirmation of sentences.  The first  one  isimmaterial  for our present purpose, as no question  of\\t anynon-appealable\\tsentence arises in the case before us.\\t Thesecond is undoubtedly a discriminatory feature and naturallyMr. Peerbhoy has laid considerable stress upon it. Section  20 of the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code  laysdown  the rule relating to confirmation of sentences in\\t thefollowing manner:\\nEvery\\tSessions Judge may pass any sentence authorised\\t bylaw,  but  such sentence shall not be  carried\\tinto  effectuntil (1)\\t in  the  case of a sentence of\\t 10  years  \\'impri-sonment or more, the appropriate Bench of the High Court;(2)  in the case of life imprisonment, the Government; and(3) in the case of death sentence, H.E.H. the Nizam, shall\\thave assented thereto.\\tSection 302  provides  thatwhen  a sessions court as passe a sentence of death  \\'or  oflife imprisonment or of imprisonment exceeding 10 years, thefile  of the case shall be forwarded to the High  Court\\t andthe execution of the sentence stayed until manjuri is  givenin accordance with section 20.\\tSection 307 further providesthat  when the High Court has affirmed a death\\tsentence  orsentence  of  life imprisonment, then its  opinion  togetherwith   the  file  of  the  case\\t shall\\tbe  forwarded\\'\\t forratification  to  the  Government within one  week  and\\t thesentence  shall not be carried into effect until  after\\t theassent\\tthereon\\t of H.E.H. the Nizam in the  case  of  deathsentences and of the Government in the case of671sentences of life imprisonment.\\t Mr. Peerbhoy\\'s complaint isthat  the  sentence  imposed upon his  client  has,  in\\t thepresent case, neither been\\' confirmed by the High Court, norby  H.E.H.  the Nizam.\\tThis, he says, is  a  discriminationwhich  has vitally prejudiced his client and does  afford  aground for setting aside the sentence in its entirety. It. admits of no dispute that section 8 of Regulation X of1359F.\\tmust be held to be invalid under articles 13(1)\\t and14  of the Constitution to the I extent that it\\t takes\\tawaythe  provision relating to confirmation of sentences  as  iscontained  in the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Code.   This,however,  is  a\\t severable part of  the\\t section  and  beinginvalid, the provisions of the Hyderabad Criminal  ProcedureCode  with regard to the confirmation of sentences  must  befollowed.   Those provisions, however, do not affect in\\t anyway  the  procedure for trial laid down in  the\\t Regulation.All that section 20 of the Hyderabad Criminal Procedure Codelays down is that sentences of particular description shouldnot be executed unless assent of certain authorities to\\t thesame  is obtained.  The proper stage, therefore, when  this,section comes into operation. is the stage of the  executionof the sentence.  The trial or conviction of the accused  isnot  affected in any way by reason of the withdrawal of\\t theprovision  relating  to\\t confirmation of  sentences  in\\t theRegulation.  The withdrawal is certainly inoperative and  inspite  of  such\\t withdrawal the accused can  insist  on\\t therights provided \\'for under the general law. In  the case before us the records show that no  referencewas  made by the Special Judge after he passed the  sentenceof  death upon the appellant in the manner  contemplated  bysection\\t 307  of the Hyderabad Code,  which  corresponds  tosection\\t 374 of the Indian Criminal Procedure  Code.   Therewas,  however,\\tan appeal preferred by the accused  and\\t theentire\\tfile  of the case came up before the High  Court  inthat connection.  As said already, the Division Bench, whichheard the appeal, was divided in its672opinion and consequently no question of confirmation of\\t thedeath  sentence could or did arise before that\\tBench.\\t Thequestion  was,\\thowever,  specifically\\traised\\ttowards\\t theconclusion of the arguments before the third Judge, to\\twhomit  was\\t referred; and it is significant to note  that\\tsometime  before that a Full Bench of the Hyderabad\\t High  Courthad decided that the provision in the Regulation relating toconfirmation  of  sentences  was void  and  inoperative\\t andconsequently  in spite of the said provision  the  sentenceswere required to be confirmed in accordance with the generallaw.  The question was then raised whether the\\tconfirmationwas to be made by the third Judge alone or it had to be doneby the two Judges who agreed in dismissing the appeal.\\t Mr.Justice\\t Manohar Prasad decided that as the whole  case\\t wasreferred  to him, he alone was competent to make  the  orderfor  confirmation of the death sentence and he did  actuallyconfirm it by writing out in his own hand the order  passingthe  sentence of death according to the provision laid\\tdownin  the\\t Hyderabad Code.  Mr. Peerbhoy\\tcontends  that\\tthisconfirmation was illegal and altogether invalid as not beingmade  in  conformity with the provisions  of  the  HyderabadCode.\\tWe do not want to express any opinion on this  pointat  the\\t present moment.  There appears on the face  of\\t therecord an order for confirmation of the death sentence\\tmadeby  a  Judge  of the High Court. If this  order\\t is  not  inconformity  with the provisions of law, the question may  beraised\\tbefore\\tthis  court when the  appeal  comes  up\\t forhearing\\t I  on its merits.  This is, however, not  a  matterwhich affects the constitutional question with which only weare concerned at the present stage.\\nUnder\\tsection\\t 20  of the Hyderabad  Code,  as  mentionedabove,\\ta  death sentence could not be executed\\t unless\\t theassent\\tof  H.E.H.  the Nizam was  obtained.   Mr.  Peerbhoypoints out that this has not been done in the present  case.To  that  the obvious reply is that consent  of\\t H.E.H.\\t theNizam is necessary only before the sentence is executed, andthat stage apparently673has,  not  arrived as yet.  The final judgment of  the\\tHighCourt in this case was passed on 11th December, 1950.  Therewas  an\\t application for leave to appeal  presented  by\\t theaccused immediately after that date and this application wasrejected  on  2nd January, 1951.  On the  5th  of  February,1951,  an  application for special leave was  made  to\\tthiscourt  and  the execution of the death sentence\\t was  stayedduring\\tthis period under orders of the High  Court  itself.The  special  leave was granted by this court on  11th\\tMay,1951,  and the carrying out of the death sentence  has\\tbeenstayed since then under our orders, pending the disposal  ofthe  appeal.   The  question  as  to  whether  any   furtherconfirmation  by  H.E.H. the Nizam is necessary\\t could\\tonlyarise  if and when the death sentence passed by\\t the  courtsbelow is upheld by this court.\\tMr. Peerbhoy points out thatsince  the  1st April, 1951, the Indian\\t Criminal  ProcedureCode has been introduced in the State of Hyderabad and thereis no power in the Nizam now to confirm a sentence of death,although  such confirmation was necessary at the  time\\twhenthe  sentence-was  pronounced both by the Special  Judge  aswell  as by the High Court on appeal.  We do not think\\tthatit  is\\tat  all necessary for us at  the  present  stage  todiscuss the effect of this change of law.  If the assent  ofthe  Nizam to the execution of a death sentence is a  matterof procedure, it may be argued that the procedural law whichobtains\\t at  the  present moment is the\\t proper\\t law  to  beapplied.   On  the  other  hand, if it\\twas  a\\tquestion  ofsubstantive right, it may be open to contention that the lawwhich governed the parties at the date when the trial  beganis  still applicable.  We are, however, not called  upon  toexpress\\t any  opinion  on this\\tpoint  and  we\\tdeliberatelydecline to do so.  We also do not express any opinion as  towhether\\t the  rights which could be exercised by  the  Nizamunder  section 20 of the Hyderabad Criminal  Procedure\\tCodewere  appurtenant to his prerogative as a sovereign or\\twerestatutory rights exercisable by the person designated in thestatute.  These matters674may be considered when the appeal comes up for final hearingon  the merits.\\t Our conclusion is that there has  not\\tbeenany  discrimination  in matters of procedure  in  this\\tcasewhich\\tcan   be  said\\tto,  have  affected  f\\t the   trialprejudicially  against\\tthe accused and the accused  is\\t notentitled  to \\'have his conviction and sentence set aside  onthat ground.\\nThe  other  question raised by the appellant\\trelates\\t todelegation  of the authority by the Chief Minister  to\\tmakeover  cases  for trial by the Special Judge.   Mr.  Peerbhoylays \\'stress on section 5 (b) of the Regulation which speaksof offences being \" made over to the Special Judge for trialby the Chief Minister or by a person authorised by the chiefMinister  in  this  behalf \", and it  is  argued  that\\tthissection\\t requires that the delegatee is to be  mentioned  byname.  What the Chief Minister has done is that he issued  anotification  authorising  all civil administrators  of\\t thedistricts to exercise within their respective  jurisdictionsthe  powers  of the Chief Minister under the  said  section.This, it is argued, is not in compliance with the provisionsof  the section.  We do not think there is any substance  inthis  contention.  The delegates can certainly be  describedby  reference to his official designation and the  authoritymay  be vested in the holder of a particular office for\\t thetime  being.   This,  we  think,  is  quite  a\\tproper\\t andconvenient   way   of  delegating  the\\tpowers\\t which\\t areexercisable  by\\t the Chief Minister.  In  our  opinion,\\t theconstitutional\\tpoints\\traised by Mr.  Peerbhoy\\t fail.\\t Theapplication  under  article 32 of the Constitution  is\\tthusrejected and the case is directed to be posted in the  usualcourse for being heard on its merits.\\nGHULAM\\t HASAN\\tJ.-I  concur in the order  proposed  by\\t mylearned\\t brother  Mr. Justice Mukherjea\\t that  the  petitionunder  article\\t32 of the Constitution be dismissed,  but  Ideem  it necessary to make a few observations in view of  mydissenting judgment in Qasim Razvi\\'s case(1).  The  majorityjudgment  delivered  by Mr. Justice Mukherjea on  the.\\t19thJanuary, 1953, in(1)  [1952] S-C-R, 710.\\nQasim  Razvi\\'s\\tcase(1) while interpreting the\\tdecision  inLachmandas  Kewalram Ahuja v. The State of  Bombay(1)  laid,down  the  principle  that the mere fact that  some  of\\t theprovisions of the impugned Regulation are discriminatory  onthe  face of it, is not sufficient to render the  trial\\t andthe  conviction void under article 14, read with article  13(1)  of\\t the Constitution and that in such cases  where\\t thetrial  is continued after the 26th January, 1950, under\\t theimpugned  Regulation,  it is necessary to  see\\twhether\\t theprocedure  followed  after  the material date  was  such  asdeprived the accused of the equal protection of laws  withinthe  meaning of article 14 of the Constitution and  that  ifthe accused under such procedure received substantially\\t thebenefits of the trial under the ordinary law, the trial\\t andconviction  cannot be held as void and illegal.\\t I  take  itthat the majority decision is binding and that the principleenunciated  by the majority is no longer open  to  question.With this preliminary observation I must proceed to  expressmy  concurrence generally with the view taken by my  learnedbrother Mr. Justice Mukherjea in the present case. It  is\\t to be borne in mind that Regulation V of  1358\\t F.under  which  the  Tribunal was\\t constituted  to  try  QasimRazvi\\'s\\t case  was  in\\tmaterial  respects  different\\tfromRegulation X of 1359 F. under which the Special Judge  triedthe  petitioner Habeeb Mohammad.  I agree with\\tmy  learnedbrother in holding that there was no flaw in making over thecase of the petitioner for trial to the Special Judge  undersection\\t 5  (b) of the Regulation.  The Special\\t Judge\\ttookcognizance  of\\tthe case before the Constitution  came\\tintoforce,\\tbut the entire evidence of the\\tprosecution,  unlikeQasim Razvi\\'s case, was recorded after the 26th of  January,1950.\\tThe Regulation in question was challenged before  usas  being void under article 14 read with article  13(1)  ofthe Constitution on the\\t following grounds:-(1) [1953] S.C.R. 589.\\t (2) [1933] S.C.R. 589.', '1': \"that the Regulation excludes the committal proceedings,(2)  that the procedure of the sessions trial is replaced bythe warrant procedure,(3)  that there is no right of transfer,(4)  that there is no revision,(5)  that the right of confirmation by the Nizamin case of sentences of death has been negatived.  As regards the first two grounds, Mr. Justice\\t Mukherjea,following  the view taken in Qasim Razvi's case(1) has\\theldthat under section 267A 'of the Hyderabad Criminal ProcedureCode committal proceedings are not compulsory and that thereis  no substantial difference , between the  sessions  trialand  the  warrant  procedure  which  was  followed  in\\t thepetitioner's case.  These two grounds of attack there.\\tforedisappear.   So\\t far  as  grounds  Nos.\\t (3)  and  (4)\\t areconcerned,  I  agree  with  Mr.\\t Justice  Mukherjea  in\\t hisinterpretation\\tof section 8 of the Regulation and  hold  inconcurrence  with  the view taken by him that the  right  toapply  for  transfer has not been taken away  and  that\\t theright  of  revision has been denied only in so far  as\\tnon-appealable  sentences are concerned.  The present is a\\tcaseof  murder and other serious offences which are\\t undoubtedlyall appealable.\\nThe  only  discriminatory feature of the  Regulation  lefttherefore is that no sentence of a Special Tribunal shall besubject\\t to or submitted for confirmation by  any  authoritywhatsoever  contained  in section 7 (2) of Regulation  V  of1358F which is made applicable,under section 8 of RegulationX of 1359 F., in other words, that the right of the Nizam toconfirm the death sentence has been taken away.\\t This is un-questionably  a valuable right available to the accused\\t whois  sentenced  to death by the Sessions Judge  or  the\\tHighCourt  as  the case may be.  We were told by  Mr.  Peerbhoy,counsel for the petitioner, that no death sentence passed bythe' courts in Hyderabad during the last 50 years or go\\t hasever been carried into effect and that the Nizam has  alwaysexercised(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 589,677this  right in favour of commuting the death  sentence\\tto.asentence  for  life.   The  denial  of\\tthis  right  in\\t theRegulation is discriminatory on the face of it and  deprivesthe  petitioner\\t of a valuable right.  I  concede,  however,that  this  objectionable  feature  of\\tthe  Regulation\\t  isseverable  from the other parts.  I further agree  that\\t thestage for the exercise of that right has not yet arisen, forthe appeal of the petitioner is still pending in this court.If  the\\t appeal is allowed, or the sentence is\\treduced,  noquestion  of the confirmation of the death sentence  by\\t theNizam will arise.  If, however, the appeal is dismissed,  itwill  be  open to the petitioner to claim  this\\t right.\\t  Itwould  not be desirable at this stage to express an  opinionwhether this right is a substantive right which vests in thepetitioner or one relating to a more matter of procedure, asthat  question will have to be considered and  decided\\twhenthe appropriate stage arrives.\\nI would, therefore, agree in dismissing the petition.\\nPetition dismissed.\\nAgent for the petitioner: Bajinder Narain.Agent for the respondent : G.
