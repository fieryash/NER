sanitary inspector training course conducted by the rural institute thavannur noteksssr partii rule10aii is applicable for selection to this post the note above has some bearing on the outcome of the present case 4 on 29 may 2015 a notification was published for posts in five additional districts the qualifications for the post remained the same on 27 november 2015 a common written test was conducted on 16 november 2016 kpsc published a list of selected candidates for the district of kottayam lists containing the names of candidates selected for other districts were also published candidates possessing the qualification of a diploma in health inspectors course2 a twoyear course conducted by the director of health service were also included in the shortlists the dhic was not one of the qualifications specifically prescribed in the rules or in the advertisement candidates who claimed to be affected by the inclusion of candidates possessing a dhic qualification filed cases before the tribunal challenging the state‘s decision to include persons possessing a dhic qualification in the shortlists 5 during the pendency of the proceedings before the tribunal on 10 january 2017 a threemember committee conducted a comparative study of the syllabi of 2 ―dhic‖ 3 the dhic programme and the sanitary inspector diploma course3 the committee submitted a report holding that 6 on 20 february 2017 kpsc filed a reply before the tribunal stating that the two year dhic is a higher qualification in the same faculty and that it had accordingly been decided to consider candidates possessing a dhic for the post of junior health inspector gradeii by adhering to the provisions of rule 10aii of the kerala state and subordinate services rules 19584 on 24 may 2017 the office of the director of health service addressed a communication to the principal secretary local self government institutions department thiruvananthapuram to consider candidates with a dhic qualification for the post of junior health inspector in the municipal common service on 7 july 2017 the principal secretary to the government in the local self government eu department addressed a 3 ―sidc‖ 4 ―ksssr‖ 4 communication to the secretary kpsc stating that in the view of the state government the dhic qualification can be reckoned to be a higher qualification in comparison with the qualifications prescribed in the notification the tribunal was subsequently informed of this decision 7 the tribunal by its judgment dated 20 december 2017 allowed the oas instituted before it and directed that the shortlist of candidates be recast by excluding candidates in possession of the dhic qualification the tribunal issued this direction after holding that kpsc had erroneously entertained applications from holders of the dhic qualification aggrieved by the decision of the tribunal the writ jurisdiction of the high court was invoked by candidates affected the high court dismissed the writ proceedings holding that the report of the threemember committee merely concludes that the dhic is a ‗higher qualification‘ than the certificate course which is not sufficient under rule 10aii of part ii of the ksssr the high court observed that the report does not indicate that the acquisition of the diploma presupposes the completion of the certificate course prescribed for the post moreover the high court held that the entire exercise by the committee was carried out after the publication of the shortlists by kpsc and during the pendency of the proceedings before the tribunal in this backdrop it was held that the rules governing the process of selection could not be altered midway on this ground the writ petition was dismissed 5 8 assailing the judgment of the high court mr s nagamuthu learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that an exercise was carried out under rule 10aii for the purpose of determining the equivalence of the dhic qualification with the sanitary inspector certificate course originally prescribed for the post in question the notification inviting applications contained a specific reference to rule 10aii hence it was urged that once the state government concluded that the dhic was a higher qualification the tribunal should not have directed the exclusion of persons possessing the said qualification that apart it was urged relying on the decision of this court in jyoti k k v kerala public service commission5 ―jyoti k k‖ that if a person possesses a higher qualification in the same faculty such a qualification can be stated to presuppose the acquisition of the lower qualifications prescribed for the post learned senior counsel submitted that the judgment of the high court is contrary to public interest since holders of the dhic qualification undergo a better course than the sidc which was prescribed as a qualification in 1972 hence it was submitted that once a committee had upon a detailed evaluation concluded that the dhic course is a higher qualification there was no justification for the tribunal to direct the exclusion of candidates possessing the dhic qualification 9 both the state government and kpsc have supported the line of argument put forth by the appellants it has been urged on their behalf that while affirming the judgment of the tribunal the high court has only considered one aspect of rule 5 2010 15 scc 596 6 10aii – whether the higher qualification presupposes the acquisition of the lower qualification prescribed for the post – ignoring the other part which allows a determination by kpsc under rule 13bi of the special rules 10 mr v giri learned senior counsel supported the judgment of the tribunal and the high court he submitted that in the present case there was no determination of the equivalence of the qualifications in advance and it was only during the pendency of the proceedings before the tribunal that such an exercise was carried out learned senior counsel submitted that the rules could not be changed mid way it has been urged that the post of junior health inspector gradeii is available both in the municipal common service as well as in the health services department in the health services department the qualification for the post is a dhic whereas in the municipal common service the qualification for the post is generally the sanitary inspector‘s certificate hence it was urged that there is a clear distinction between the posts in the two departments the sidc conducted by the local self government institutions rural educational department and the dhic conducted by the directorate of health services are designed keeping in view the different duties and functions attached to those two posts in their respective departments moreover it was submitted that responses to queries under the right to information act 2005 revealed that the dhic course conducted by the directorate of health service is not of a superior qualification to the sidc in a communication dated 14 march 2017 the director of urban affairs specified that the dhic 7 programme conducted by the directorate of health services is neither an equivalent nor higher qualification to the sidc certificate course prescribed as a qualification for the post of junior health inspector gradeii in the municipal common service this was reiterated by the personal and administrative reforms department on 16 may 2017 11 the starting point of our enquiry in the present case is the order of the state government dated 16 august 1972 published in the kerala gazette on 29 august 1972 it specifies the minimum qualifications required for the post of health inspector food inspector gradeii the qualification prescribed is a sanitary inspector‘s certificate originating in specified institutions the dhic is admittedly not one of the specified qualifications for the post reliance was however placed on the provisions of rule 10aii of part ii of the ksssr rule 10aii reads as follows rule 10aii commences with a nonobstante provision it contemplates three situations i qualifications recognized by executive orders or standing orders of the government as being equivalent to a qualification specified for a post in the special rules or ii qualifications found acceptable by the commission in accordance with rule 13bi in cases where acceptance of equivalent qualifications is provided for in the special rules and iii qualifications which presuppose the acquisition of a lower qualification prescribed for the post any of these would be treated as sufficient for the post the tribunal observed that although a diploma course could be treated as superior to a certificate course to qualify under rule 10aii the diploma course should be one which presupposes the completion of the certificate course in that context the tribunal held the tribunal noted that the duties and functions attached to the junior health inspector‘s post in the municipal common service are distinct from those in the health services department moreover the tribunal noted that neither kpsc nor any duly constituted authority had endeavoured to determine whether the dhic is to be treated as a superior qualification the tribunal held according to the secretary in the light of the above information considering that dhic qualification was prescribed for the post of junior health inspector grade ii in the health service department it could be viewed as a higher qualification to the qualification prescribed for the post of junior health inspector grade ii in municipal common service it is noted that annexure r5a communication only offers an opinion it does not declare the above course of dhic to be a superior qualification it also does not consider the fact whether the possession of dhic would presuppose 10 the possession of sanitary inspectors course and whether the junior health inspectors post in the directorate of health services was a superior post to that of the junior health inspectors post in municipal common service moreover annexure r5a communication it is noted is not an executive order coming within the purview of articles 162 and 166 of the constitution of india annexure 5a is in the nature of a communication expressing an opinion to a query by the public service commission the same does not declare dhic course to be a superior qualification to that of sanitary inspectors course in accordance with rule 10aii and 13bi part ii ksssr this view of the tribunal has been accepted by the high court 12 on a careful analysis it emerges that none of the conditions stipulated in rule 10aii have been fulfilled the first situation contemplated by rule 10aii is where qualifications are recognized by executive orders or standing orders of the government as equivalent to a qualification specified for a post this is not satisfied with reference to the second situation contemplated in rule 10aii there was no determination by kpsc in accordance with rule 13bi of the equivalence of the qualifications6 finally the last condition contemplated in rule 10aii adverts to those qualifications which presuppose the acquisition of a lower qualification prescribed for a post the expression presuppose means subsumed in all that we 6 rule 13bi provides thus ―13 special qualifications no person shall be eligible for appointment to any service class category or grade or any post borne on the cadre thereof unless he  … b possesses such other qualifications as may be considered to be equivalence to the said special qualifications or special tests i by the commission in cases where the appointment has to be made in consultation with it or…‖ 11 find from the report of the threemember committee are general

that the acquisition of the dhic presupposes the completion of the certificate course 13 the decision in jyoti k k concerned a situation where kpsc invited applications for selection for the post of subengineers electrical in the kerala state electricity board7 the technical qualifications prescribed were as follows kpsc has not carried out any exercise as required by the provisions of the rule
